"How can the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> be older than the universe itself?": "Unknown Nomai",
"Suppose it is a relic from a previous universe.": "Unknown Nomai",
"The early universe was unimaginably hot and dense. If anything existed before, it would have been destroyed.": "Unknown Nomai",
"Suppose the universe is older than previously assumed.": "Unknown Nomai",
"The <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> requires a powerful, highly advanced warp core. How should we obtain it?": "Unknown Nomai",
"Solution 2: We could craft a new advanced warp core inspired by the <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s warp core.": "Unknown Nomai",
"OENO: The greatest challenge here, I think, is we don’t have the design for such a powerful core, or any of the original crafters of the <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s core.": "Oeno",
"CLARY: No, but Poke was apprenticed to Annona, who created the original design, and our <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color> is adept at crafting simpler cores.": "Clary",
"POKE: I believe I can be of use here! The <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s warp core was created before my time, but Annona explained many of his designs to me.": "Poke",
"IDAEA: This is the safest path for our clan.": "Idaea",
"AVENS: Is the safest path the best one? Our goal is worth the risk.": "Avens",
"CASSAVA: Is it, though? We’ve tried for so long to find something that I (and others) now believe might be impossible to find. If the search for the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is a futile one, we should choose the option with the least potential for harm.": "Cassava",
"SPIRE: Abandoning the <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s warp core and its casing means losing valuable knowledge.": "Spire",
"MITIS: This is true; however, it’s knowledge we have little hope of recovering. It would be best to relearn, I think.": "Mitis",
"POKE: I would very much like to craft such a powerful core! More relevantly, I believe the <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color> crew and I could recreate the basic design.": "Poke",
"CASSAVA: I imagine I’ve been hard on Poke, again. This in turn means I’ve made things difficult for her sister (Clary).": "Cassava",
"CASSAVA: If Poke and I are oil and water, Clary is our emulsifier. She certainly makes us a better team than would mixing through shaking (although sometimes I would like to shake Poke!).": "Cassava",
"CASSAVA: Jokes aside, suppose my own fear of never finding the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> prompted my argument with Poke. That would be immature of me.": "Cassava",
"CASSAVA: I should apologize... At least to Clary, who could then tell Poke.": "Cassava",
"POKE: I feel strange, trying to recreate Annona’s warp core without him. At times, it still feels strange to no longer be his (very young) apprentice, and for the <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color> to be in my care and not his.": "Poke",
"POKE: Hypothesis: This will always feel strange. Even though my time with him was short, I miss my old mentor, and deeply.": "Poke",
"POKE: To have the chance to try is thrilling, but... I don’t want to disappoint everyone. I <i>think</i> I can do this (probably), but what if excitement has clouded my assessment of my own abilities?": "Poke",
"POKE: Was I wrong in volunteering to build it...? I was born in this star system, and never saw Annona’s warp core with my own three eyes. I only know what he taught me. What if I’ve bitten off a larger portion than I can consume?": "Poke",
"POKE: Still, all I can give is my best. And as Annona would say, should my best prove insufficient, then we will find another way to achieve what’s needed. I have Clary and Root in the forge, and I have my clan. I am not alone!": "Poke",
"SOLANUM: Formation Of This Universe": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: No one knows how this universe was made, but one thing we do know is everything used to be very hot and very dense (tightly packed together).": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: As this early universe expanded, it also cooled down. Once it had cooled down enough, particles were able to group together to form things like galaxies, stars, and planets!": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: Since then, space has continued to expand at a faster and faster rate, which is hard to think about for too long without your brain hurting.": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: This universe will keep getting colder and larger, until one day, the stars and the life they support will all die.": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: That’s scary to think about, even though Conoy tells me it won’t happen in our lifetimes. But it’ll happen in someone else’s, someday!": "Solanum",

"FILIX: Don’t forget, festivals happen every ten years!": "Filix",
"LAMI: We can’t go because we’re stuck here. But Filix says we used to go, too.": "Lami",
"LAMI: At some festivals, one clan’s big discovery can mean all the Nomai get to advance, too. Like Annona’s warp core, which made it so everyone can warp long distances and explore more.": "Lami",

"CONOY: Cassava’s <color=orange>Construction Yard</color> has been using the cyclones on <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color> to lift <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> parts into orbit, but one component was pushed down past the current that usually prevents anything from sinking.": "Conoy",
"CONOY: Spire and I are crafting a model to determine why this happened.": "Conoy",
"SPIRE: An update: It’s now clear there are two different types of cyclone.": "Spire",
"SPIRE: Most cyclones on <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color> rotate clockwise. These are the cyclones Cassava typically uses to send components into orbit.": "Spire",
"SPIRE: There also exists a rarer type of cyclone that spins the opposite direction and pushes objects beneath the waters and below the current.": "Spire",
"CASSAVA: My gratitude, Spire. Conoy is showing me your handiwork, and I’m intrigued by this secondary type of cyclone. But was it really necessary to build a model to tell me that?": "Cassava",

"BELLS: We make this journey not only for ourselves, but also to honor the members of our clan who came before us: those who, after the crash that brought them to this star system, became stranded on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color> and on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>, with no communication between these two groups of survivors.": "Bells",
"BELLS: These Nomai looked upward from two different planets and saw the same wandering moon visiting their skies. It was this moon (the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>) that kept their curiosity alive during this long period of hardship.": "Bells",
"BELLS: After the two divided groups were able to reunite, it became our clan’s united goal to find and visit the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>. This took time, and many Nomai who dreamed of seeing the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color> died before we discovered how to make the journey.": "Bells",

"THATCH: Plume is right; the trees <i>do</i> move! I confess I didn’t notice until I read his notes.": "Thatch",
"THATCH: Alarmingly, it isn’t only the trees: There is other matter in this area (such as that unusual shard of rock) moving in this same eerie way.": "Thatch",
"FILIX: That rock is unusual for another reason, too, Thatch: It possesses color and texture I’ve never seen elsewhere on this planet!": "Filix",
"FILIX: Hypothesis: This rock shard’s presence is significant. We should study it! (Could it be what is causing other nearby objects to also move about this area?)": "Filix",
"THATCH: Plume, Filix, and I have determined this atypical shard of rock is the reason objects in this grove are behaving in a quantum manner.": "Thatch",
"THATCH: The only other object we’ve observed displaying this quantum behavior is the <color=lightblue>wandering moon</color>. I imagine the moon’s behavior and this grove’s are related.": "Thatch",
"PLUME: In her note from earlier, Filix mentions this strange type of rock isn’t found elsewhere on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>. What if it isn’t originally from this planet?": "Plume",
"PLUME: Hypothesis: This “quantum shard” is from the <color=lightblue>wandering (quantum) moon</color>. Perhaps it is even a small piece of the moon itself.": "Plume",
"FILIX: Of note: A unique signal is coming from this shard! Curiously, our friend the <color=lightblue>wandering moon</color> sounds the same.": "Filix",
"FILIX: I’ve also heard the same signal this shard produces calling out from <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color>,<color=lightblue>Timber Hearth</color>, and the <color=lightblue>Hourglass Twins</color>. Suppose there are other shards like this one!": "Filix",

"MELORAE: When our <color=orange>escape pod</color> punctured this planet’s surface, it broke into what scans show is a cave system with much cooler air. I <i>would</i> recommend we seek a site down there to build a long-term shelter, Annona, but these passages are a maze!": "Melorae",
"ANNONA: Even with this danger, they are still our best chance for survival. We’ll form teams and descend into the caves to look for a shelter site. We can mark our findings on the walls to avoid becoming irreversibly lost.": "Annona",
"ANNONA: Be cautious, everyone.": "Annona",
"RHUS: And be aware of the sand as you search. It appears to be rising gradually.": "Rhus",
"COLEUS: The path to the shelter site is somewhat convoluted, so follow the instructions ahead closely!": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: To reach the shelter site, walk forward until you meet the sandfall at the pit, then turn left. Continue to the room filled with rock column formations and climb upward through the opening above them.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: The sand here is rising, so you must be cautious but swift.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: Be cautious crossing the chasm ahead. The bridge Melorae and I crafted will do its job, but it isn’t strong.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: Once on the far side, look for the tunnel hidden behind the falling sand. Follow it, and you’ll reach the shelter site.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: You’re doing well! There’s only a little farther left to go now until you reach the shelter site. You can rest there. Hurry, before the sand comes!": "Coleus",
"MELORAE: Do not follow this tunnel to its end! (Coleus and I will examine the horror that lies at its terminus later, provided we live through this.)": "Melorae",
"ANNONA: Of note: This passage leads to breathable air. Refill your supply tank there (we cannot tell how far or deep these tunnels may wind), but do not linger, as the area is exposed to the heat of this alien <color=lightblue>sun</color>.": "Annona",
"ANNONA: Refill your air supply tank and return quickly.": "Annona",
"RHUS: Keep moving, friends: There is nothing of interest at the end of this passage but rocks.": "Rhus",

"CLARY: I understand, but... Be cautious, both of you.": "Clary",
"POKE: The spherical stone casing here seems to be the source of the energy readings... No, rather, the source is what’s within the stone. I’m detecting some form of exotic matter.": "Poke",
"PYE: The stone is <i>muting</i> our energy readings; they should be ten times what we’re seeing, at least.": "Pye",
"POKE: Pye, I don’t think we want this matter interacting with us. As far as I can tell, direct contact with it would almost certainly be fatal.": "Poke",
"PYE: I’ve never encountered anything like this casing, but it’s all that’s protecting us from what’s inside. Worse still, this matter is disturbingly volatile.": "Pye",
"POKE: ...Pye. Whatever the matter inside this stone casing is, it’s more than just profoundly unstable; it’s under tonnes of pressure. Look at this density scan. I’ve never seen <i>anything</i> this tightly compacted before! What <i>is</i> this?": "Poke",
"PYE: This is orders of magnitude worse than I’d imagined. If this stone were to rupture, the lethal matter within would rapidly expand, completely blanketing this star system almost instantaneously. And the pressure is still building as the <color=lightblue>comet</color> approaches this star system...": "Pye",
"PYE: Return to the shuttle, right now! The rest of our friends need to know they’re in terrible danger. Leave your equipment and run!": "Pye",
"POKE: What are you doing, Pye?!": "Poke",
"PYE: The more we know about this alien matter, the better our chances of survival. I will learn what I can here. Go, warn the others; maybe they can construct shelter somehow. ...<i>Now</i>, Poke!": "Pye",
"CLARY: I fear our situation may be dire:": "Clary",
"CLARY: Pye, Poke, and I landed here on this <color=lightblue>comet</color> not long after its arrival in this star system. Our <color=orange>shuttle</color>’s equipment heard strange energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface.": "Clary",
"CLARY: Pye and Poke were able to locate a fissure in the ice on the <color=lightblue>comet</color>’s sunward side, and they descended inside to investigate the source of the readings.": "Clary",
"CLARY: But... Pye and my sister have been gone for a long time now. They haven’t contacted me since descending below the surface, either.": "Clary",
"CLARY: Should I leave the <color=orange>shuttle</color> to look for them? I want to follow protocol, but I don’t know what I’ll do if they aren’t well...": "Clary",
"CLARY: Poke... Pye... Come back to me safely, my friends.": "Clary",
"CLARY: This is troublesome: It seems the <color=lightblue>comet</color> wishes to submerge our <color=orange>shuttle</color> in ice. If we stay on the surface too long, the <color=orange>shuttle</color> may freeze entirely.": "Clary",
"POKE: Even if it did, couldn’t someone call it back home to the <color=orange>gravity cannon</color> on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>?": "Poke",
"PYE: Yes, but the exploration of the <color=lightblue>comet</color> would be more difficult if we were without the <color=orange>shuttle</color> until someone recalled it. Perhaps we shouldn’t have landed on the dark side of the <color=lightblue>comet</color>...": "Pye",
"CLARY: Suppose one of us remained in the <color=orange>shuttle</color> to keep it warm and continue monitoring the surface.": "Clary",
"PYE: This would be wise, I think, Clary. If you don’t mind waiting here with it, Poke and I can continue to investigate the surface.": "Pye",

"CLARY: Regarding the warp towers on <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>: Does each tower have to be perfectly aligned with the center of the astral body to which it’s tuned?": "Clary",
"CLARY: I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, but if, for example, a tower’s base were to shift even slightly, that tower might no longer align with its astral body.": "Clary",
"POKE: We don’t need the alignment angle to be exact; it only needs to be within five degrees of the astral body’s center.": "Poke",
"POKE: Of note: This gives us a slightly longer warp window. I imagine this window will last roughly several seconds.": "Poke",
"POKE: As such, any Nomai stepping onto the warp platform during the active window will be immediately warped. We will need to be careful around the platform for the duration of the time it’s active to avoid accidental transportation.": "Poke",
"CLARY: More accurately, I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, provided the next Nomai is not Poke.": "Clary",
"ROOT: Where am I taking this first black hole core? (And where am I taking the remaining cores once they’re ready?)": "Root",

"POKE: Of note: Yarrow believes he spotted a flaw in the warp tower designs: namely, that one of the warp towers on <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color> will never activate, because its warp receiver will never align overhead.": "Poke",
"POKE: Does your romantic interest think a warp tower’s alignment point is its <i>receiver</i>? Does he not know that a warp tower always aligns with the center of its corresponding astral body?": "Poke",
"CLARY: That isn’t an unreasonable belief, given the receiver <i>does</i> have to be located on (or in close orbit around) the relevant astral body.": "Clary",
"CLARY: I seem to recall that was <i>your</i> understanding of warp technology, at first.": "Clary",
"CLARY: No, Yarrow understands the distinction. He likely doesn’t realize the <color=lightblue>Hourglass Twins</color> are so close together they function as a single astral body, with a shared alignment point in between them.": "Clary",

"MeetGabbro3FSo hey, don’t freak out or anything, but lately I keep, like, dying repeatedly. I dunno, it’s pretty weird.": "Gabbro",
"MeetGabbro3FWhat about you? Have you died lately, or is it just me?": "Gabbro",
"GabbroMeetGabbro3FNo, it’s me, too. We’re in a time loop.": "Gabbro/Me",
"Gabbro3F_2Time <i>has</i> been behaving unusually lately. Yeah, a time loop makes sense. Cool.": "Gabbro",
"GabbroGabbro3F_2You’re taking this pretty well.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroGabbro3F_2What did you think it was?": "Gabbro/Me",
"Gabbro3F_3Heh, right back at you.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3F_3Personally, I like new experiences, and I’ve never been in a time loop before. I mean, I don’t <i>think</i> I’ve been in a time loop before this one.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3F_4I figured it’d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn’t really thinking about what’s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let’s go with “loop” for now.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3F_5It looks like you and I are the only ones who can tell that time’s gone all weird. I tried radioing Hornfels and asking if they’d died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3F_5Even if I tell Hornfels about the time loop, they never remember by the next one. They don’t realize anything’s different.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3F_5And here’s another weird one for you - every time I die, all of my memories from that loop replay back to me. I’m pretty sure that’s related to this big stone Nomai statue I found on one of the other islands.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3F_5I was looking at it, and the statue opened its eyes and started glowing. It replayed my memories like it’d seen them through my own eyes, just like what happens each time I die.": "Gabbro",
"GabbroGabbro3F_5That happened to me with the statue at the museum.": "Gabbro/Me",
"Gabbro3F_6You too, huh? Then the Nomai statues must have something to do with why we’re the only ones aware of the time loop. So... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3F_6I think that’s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I’ll be here.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3F_6Anyway, that’s what’s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! ...Kind of! Let’s talk about you, you know?": "Gabbro",

"WhatAreYouDoing_3FWell, what are any of us doing here, really?": "Gabbro",
"WhatAreYouDoing_3F...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.": "Gabbro",
"WhatAreYouDoing_3FBut I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.": "Gabbro",
"WhatAreYouDoing_3FI mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful.": "Gabbro",
"WhereToExplore_3FHere’s something you might like — I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky at the start of every loop. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet.": "Gabbro",
"WhereToExplore_3FWhat else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the <i>island</i> where I found the glowing Nomai <i>statue</i>.<Pause> ...Get it?": "Gabbro",
"WhereToExplore_3FI was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale.": "Gabbro",
"WhereToExplore_3FIf you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see.": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3FHaha, I know, right?": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3F...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there.": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3FThere’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3FAs for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach.": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3FYou’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip — if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you.": "Gabbro",
"GabbrosShipThat’s a good question.": "Gabbro",
"GabbrosShipIt’s definitely on this planet <i>some</i>where. I mean, unless a cyclone came by and tossed it into space, I guess. Heh, that would be pretty nuts.": "Gabbro",
"GabbrosShipI hope it’s not lonely.": "Gabbro",
"GabbrosShip2An excellent question. I haven’t seen it around lately.": "Gabbro",
"GabbrosShip2I hope it’s not lonely.": "Gabbro",
"GabbrosShip3Oh, cool. So it’s floating in the ocean, huh?": "Gabbro",
"GabbrosShip3Did it look like it was having a good time?": "Gabbro",
"GabbrosShip4I hope it’s having fun! Did you say hi for me?": "Gabbro",
"GoodbyeCool, cool. Take it easy out there.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomethingMenuNice, nice. Whatcha got for me?": "Gabbro",
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI reached the inside of Statue Island.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found the source of the time loop.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found Nomai masks inside the Ash Twin Project.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found what happened to the Orbital Probe Cannon.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found your quantum poem.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found a photo of you inside the old radio tower.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuActually, nevermind.": "Gabbro/Me",
"FoundSomething1_3FSo the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething1_3FDo you think the statues are recording our memories, then? ’Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething1bRight, right, the cavern inside Statue Island is where the memory-recording statues were made, I remember.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething1bSo your memory statue is the one in the museum back in the crater, and mine’s the one I found on the beach. I kinda dig having my own personal memory-friend.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething1bIf you come up with any hunches about what the Nomai wanted to record memories for, feel free to run them by me! You know where I’ll be.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3FWait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is <i>wild</i>.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3FNow we know what’s causing the loop, then. And... if it’s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh...": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3FHey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there’s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn’t, what with the sun blowing up and all.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3FThen again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3F...I dunno, I’m no time loop expert. I’m just gonna sit here and ponder the intricacies of time and space. Maybe take a nap, too, if I feel like it.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2bMy head’s still all full of scenarios for what would happen if you turned off the time loop. I’ll probably notice if you decide to mess with it, though, right? Seems like something I’d notice.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2bThis is all pretty wild.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3_3FYou’re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3_3FWait, then it’s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3_3FThat’s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven’t, because technically the loops never happened.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3_3FMeaning we’re receiving memories of things that will never happen to us. Cool, huh?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3bRight, you told me earlier that the point of the statues is to send memories back in time. Which I guess makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3bI thought about it some more, and I think that means our minds have gone through all these loops, but we haven’t actually gone through them ourselves.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3bMeaning we’re receiving memories of things that technically will never happen to us. Cool, huh?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4_3FWhoa, that’s the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop? For real?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4_3FDid you figure out why?": "Gabbro",
"GabbroFoundSomething4_3FToo much power.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomething4_3FOverenthusiasm.": "Gabbro/Me",
"FoundSomething4FollowUp_3F...It’s kind of scary how much that sounds like something Slate or Feldspar would do. I’m pretty surprised the Nomai built something that actually broke!": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4FollowUp_3FCome to think of it, though, “broke” might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4b_3FSo the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I’m seeing fall from the sky every loop.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4b_3FI’m still surprised the Nomai built something that isn’t holding together, you know? Them being genius crafters and all.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4b_3FOn the other hand, maybe we should be impressed they made something that could last until modern day in the first place. And it looks like the cannon is still firing successfully at the start of each time loop.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething5_3FYeah, the one in the woods, I remember writing that. Pretty fun, right? It works out to a good 24 poems.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething5_3FWhen I’m done exploring, I want to make some more quantum art. Maybe some kind of creature sculpture that just, like, shows up and scares the daylights out of you.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6AgainYeah, you mentioned that before. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6BaseNice. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6Must have been from the time Hornfels sent me to check on the deep space satellite. They thought Ol’ Spacey might be malfunctioning, but I couldn’t find a single thing wrong with it.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6Which is probably how it got a shot of my beautiful be-helmeted face, come to think of it.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6I always thought it was kinda sweet that the best way to find Ol’ Spacey is to use a map that’s generated by the satellite itself, isn’t it? Like it’s inviting us to visit. Good ol’ deep space satellite, always making sure we know where we’re going.": "Gabbro",
"GabbroFoundSomething6Why’d Hornfels think it was broken?": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomething6Um. “Ol’ Spacey”?": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomething6I have a map?!": "Gabbro/Me",
"FoundSomething6aDunno. Hornfels probably told me why, but Hornfels tells me lots of things, and sometimes I tune out. Or pretend there’s signal interference and I can’t hear them.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6aBest guess says the deep space satellite must have sent Timber Hearth some weird pictures, but like… what’s considered “weird” for a satellite, you know?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6aAnyway, if you ever want to visit Ol’ Spacey, fastest way is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to the satellite, same as you would any astral body.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6bI mean, the satellite’s not <i>super</i> old, but it’s hardly brand-new. “Ol’” is more a term of affection. ...You’re being very literal-minded about this.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6bOl’ Spacey likes visitors, you know! Fastest way to find it is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to our faithful satellite friend, same as you would any astral body.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6cYeah, um, the one that’s standard with all our spacesuits? The one you have with you at all times that opens with the press of a button? …That map?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6cYou didn’t get conked on the head by a rock or a meteorite or something on your way here, did you? No shame in that. Happens to me all the time!": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething6cIn case you were hit especially hard, don’t forget that you can jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to any astral body. It’s the easiest way to visit Ol’ Spacey, too.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomethingExitNo worries. Feel free to let me know when you do find something cool, though. You know where to find me.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3T_1I was hoping you’d be back - something <i>really</i> weird is going on.": "Gabbro",
"GabbroGabbro3T_1Do you think we’re in a time loop?": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroGabbro3T_1We’re definitely in a time loop.": "Gabbro/Me",
"Gabbro3T_2Yeah, a time loop makes the most sense, right? Or at least, it’s some kind of fidgety time business. Hard to say what’s happening to the shape of time, exactly, but let’s go with “loop” for now.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3T_3Oh. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool.": "Gabbro",
"GabbroGabbro3T_3You’re taking this pretty well.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroGabbro3T_3What did you think it was?": "Gabbro/Me",
"Gabbro3T_4Heh, right back at you. Personally, I like new experiences, and I’ve never been in a time loop before.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3T_4Well. I don’t <i>think</i> I’ve been in a time loop before this one, but then, it’s not like I can know that for sure.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3T_5I figured it’d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn’t really thinking about what’s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let’s go with “loop” for now.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3T_6So it looks like you and I are the only ones who know we’re in a time loop. And even if you tell them about it, no one remembers by the next loop. What’s with that?": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3T_6Maybe it’s because we both made some seriously intense eye contact with a Nomai statue?": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3T_6I’m seeing my memories replay each time I die, just like I did when the Nomai statue on the beach opened its eyes and looked at me. So maybe... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3T_6I think that’s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I’ll be here.": "Gabbro",
"Gabbro3T_SecondaryHey, my time buddy’s back!": "Gabbro",
"GabbroMenuSo what’s new?": "Gabbro",
"WhatAreYouDoing_3TWell, what are any of us doing here, really?": "Gabbro",
"WhatAreYouDoing_3T...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.": "Gabbro",
"WhatAreYouDoing_3TBut I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.": "Gabbro",
"WhatAreYouDoing_3TI mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful.": "Gabbro",
"WhereToExplore_3THere’s something you might like — I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky at the start of every loop. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet.": "Gabbro",
"WhereToExplore_3TWhat else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the <i>island</i> where I found the glowing Nomai <i>statue</i>.<Pause> ...Get it?": "Gabbro",
"WhereToExplore_3TI was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale.": "Gabbro",
"WhereToExplore_3TIf you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see.": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3THaha, I know, right?": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3T...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there.": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3TThere’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3TAs for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach.": "Gabbro",
"ThisPlanet_3TYou’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip - if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething1_3TSo the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething1_3TDo you think the statues are recording our memories, then? ’Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3TWait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is <i>wild</i>.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3TNow we know what’s causing the loop, then. And... if it’s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh...": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3THey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there’s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn’t, what with the sun blowing up and all.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3TThen again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething2_3T...I dunno, I’m no time loop expert. I’m just gonna sit here and ponder the intricacies of time and space. Maybe take a nap, too, if I feel like it.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3_3TYou’re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3_3TWait, then it’s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3_3TThat’s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven’t, because technically the loops never happened.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething3_3TMeaning we’re receiving memories of things that will never happen to us. Cool, huh?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4_3TWhoa, that’s the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop? For real?": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4_3TDid you figure out why?": "Gabbro",
"GabbroFoundSomething4_3TToo much power.": "Gabbro/Me",
"GabbroFoundSomething4_3TOverenthusiasm.": "Gabbro/Me",
"FoundSomething4FollowUp_3T...It’s kind of scary how much that sounds like something Slate or Feldspar would do. I’m pretty surprised the Nomai built something that actually broke!": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4FollowUp_3TCome to think of it, though, “broke” might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4b_3TSo the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I’m seeing fall from the sky every loop.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4b_3TI’m still surprised the Nomai built something that isn’t holding together, you know? Them being genius crafters and all.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething4b_3TOn the other hand, maybe we should be impressed they made something that could last until modern day in the first place. And it looks like the cannon is still firing successfully at the start of each time loop.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething5_3TYeah, the one in the woods, I remember writing that. Pretty fun, right? It works out to a good 24 poems.": "Gabbro",
"FoundSomething5_3TWhen I’m done exploring, I want to make some more quantum art. Maybe some kind of creature sculpture that just, like, shows up and scares the daylights out of you.": "Gabbro",
"GabbroMainHey, time pal! Nice weather we’re having, huh? <Pause/>...Wait. Have I used that one before?": "Gabbro",
"GabbroMainIf it isn’t my time buddy! How’s space treating you this loop?": "Gabbro",
"GabbroMainHeyo, time buddy. It’s a good thing I never get bored of rain, huh?": "Gabbro",
"GabbroMainYou know, I kind of wish I’d built a hammock here before we ended up in this time loop.": "Gabbro",
"GabbroMainA few loops ago, a cyclone came by and tossed my little island into space. Dying like that was kind of unpleasant.": "Gabbro",
"GabbroMain_SecondaryHello again. ...Again.": "Gabbro",
"GabbroMenuWhat’s up?": "Gabbro",
"GabbroGabbroMenuHow do you stay so calm in the face of repeated impending death?": "Gabbro/Me",
"HowDoYouStayCalmDeep breaths... no, seriously, I meditate.": "Gabbro",
"MeditateMenuWant me to teach you? It'll be the next loop before you know it.": "Gabbro",

"GabbroMeditateMenuNah, I'm good.": "Gabbro/Me",
"YesMeditateOk, close your eyes...": "Gabbro",

"SlateScientist1AAll systems go!": "Slate/Me",
"SlateScientist1AI’m ready if you are.": "Slate/Me",

"ScientistAnswer11Whoa, bad dream or something? You still look half asleep, but that’s a negative on being deceased.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer11I know it’s tradition to sleep out under the stars the night before a launch, but if you ask me it makes you all a bit jumpy.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer12Glad you’re excited, but remember, if you wreck the ship I’m not building you a new one. I’m not made of lightweight reentry grade aluminum alloys, you know.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer13Are you kidding? Of course I’m ready - it’s finally time to test the new landing hydraulics with a pilot instead of the autoflight system!": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer13...Speaking of pilots, make sure you don’t crash the ship the first time you put it down, you hear?": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer14That was only a problem one time. And then maybe a few times after that, but hey, no reason to dwell on the past, right?": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer15Anyway, you’ll need to get the <color=orange>launch codes from Hornfels at the observatory</color> before you can lift off. Just bring those here once you’ve said your goodbyes or whatever.": "Slate",

"ScientistAnswer25Oh, and Gossan says they have the zero-g chamber set up if you want a refresher on making ship repairs in space. Not saying you <i>have</i> to, but uh, it’d help get Gossan off my back if you did.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer21Hornfels has the launch codes. Should be up at the observatory, like usual. I’m starting to think they live there.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer22Great! Hey, you might get a kick out of this - I’ve repurposed the spare oxygen tank to be used as an extra combustion chamber!": "Slate",
"SlateScientistAnswer22What does that do?": "Slate/Me",
"SlateScientistAnswer22Is that... safe?": "Slate/Me",
"ScientistAnswer221Well, it’s all very conceptual, but basically, it’s like taking a regular second-stage booster and strapping a bigger rocket onto it. \\\\nIsn’t that <i>great</i>?": "Slate",

"ScientistAnswer23Oh, it’s a perfect ten. Unless you’re factoring in pilot error, in which case it’s about a four.\\\\nNo offense.": "Slate",

"SlateScientist3I already got them from the observatory, remember?": "Slate/Me",
"SlateScientist3How did I get back here? Didn’t I already lift off?": "Slate/Me",
"SlateScientist3Wait, did I just <i>die</i>, or...?": "Slate/Me",
"ScientistAnswer31Huh. Must be inhaling more fumes than I realized. That stuff is <i>potent</i>.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer31Well, if you’ve got the codes, I’m not gonna stop you. Good luck, and take care of that ship!": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer32Trust me -- with the modifications I’ve made to those rockets? There’s no way I would have missed that.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer32I won’t ask how you got the launch codes, but since you have ’em, get a move on! I want to see whether the new cockpit stays attached during liftoff.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer33Uh, <i>no</i>...? You have a bad dream or something?": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer33I won’t ask how you got the codes, so hurry up and launch before Hornfels decides to ground you for medical reasons.  I want to see whether the new cockpit stays attached during liftoff.": "Slate",
"Scientist4Looks like you’re ready for takeoff! The excitement of a launch is fun and all, but I can’t wait to get back to working on the new ship.\\\\nWe’re working on fixing the autopilot’s avoidance system for this one!": "Slate",

"SlateScientist5Did you know it’s just an endless void outside our solar system?": "Slate/Me",
"ScientistAnswer35Well yeah, it’s a death-trap, but a really <i>powerful</i> death trap. What, you suddenly care about safety <i>now</i>?": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer36And you’re lucky I don’t have you grounded for medical reasons, because I have no idea what you’re talking about.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer37Had an exciting dream, did you?": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer37It’s not exactly <i>impossible</i> for the autopilot to get you too close to the sun, but it’s not like it’ll try to take you there on purpose.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer37Make sure the sun isn’t between you and your destination when you engage autopilot, and you’ll be fine.": "Slate",
"ScientistAnswer38Use your scout to detect it, you dumb idiot! Did you think I made that just so you could take pretty little pictures of trees? It has multiple uses!": "Slate",

"ScientistAnswer39Oh yeah, the observatory has an exhibit about that.": "Slate",

"SlateSlate_ShipLog_IntroYeah yeah yeah, I already know about the launch codes.": "Slate/Me",
"Slate_ShipLog_1What? No, I was going to tell you about using the ship log to set destination markers for locations you’ve visited before.": "Slate",
"Slate_ShipLog_1It’s a brilliant feature, if I say so myself. Dead useful. And the risk it poses of shorting out the fuel regulator and causing the ship to explode is so minimal that only Gossan would worry about it.": "Slate",
"SlateSlate_ShipLog_1Wait, so how do I use it?": "Slate/Me",
"SlateSlate_ShipLog_1Use the ship log to mark a location I want to revisit. Got it.": "Slate/Me",
"SlateSlate_ShipLog_1How minimal are we talking?": "Slate/Me",
"SlateSlate_ShipLog_1What about locations I haven’t visited before?": "Slate/Me",
"Slate_ShipLog_1aWhen you’re on your ship, open up its log to the location you want to mark. Anywhere’s fine, as long as you’ve been there at least once.": "Slate",
"Slate_ShipLog_1aHop in the pilot seat, and the ship will throw up a destination marker on your display. It’s that easy.": "Slate",
"Slate_ShipLog_1bMinimal! Stars above, you worry too much. If anything’s going to kill you, it’s the autopilot.": "Slate",
"Slate_ShipLog_1cOh, sure, I’ll just magically have the system know all the possible locations you plan to discover throughout the entire solar system, shall I?": "Slate",

"Feldspar5It’s either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and my poor, fried ship.": "Feldspar",

"FeldsparExploreI’ve had a lot of time to think about this, and my theory is space in Dark Bramble kind of expands as you go through each sphere. That’s why it’s bigger inside those seeds.": "Feldspar",

"RAMIE: Inviting sand inside would disrupt our setup and could have enormous consequences. (We realize this is an intriguing prospect, but the door must remain closed nonetheless!)": "Ramie",
"RAMIE: An update: The <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color> is now being used to design the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>! If you’re here to help (or even just to observe), be sure to use the <color=orange>Sunless City</color> path to the lab.": "Ramie",
"RAMIE: The <color=orange>Southern Observatory</color> is asking if creating a 22 minute interval is possible (that is, to have something arrive 22 minutes before it is actually sent through the warp).": "Ramie",
"RAMIE: We’ve learned the negative interval of time between departure and arrival can be increased by adding more energy to the warp core. Problematically, the energy required to extend the interval increases at an exponential rate.": "Ramie",
"PYE: Hypothesis: Creating a 22-minute-long interval is possible, but we are currently unable to generate the necessary energy.": "Pye",
"PYE: Ramie and I believe it would be necessary to invent a new method of producing energy, a thrilling but enormous undertaking. We would also require advanced warp technology able to handle such energy.": "Pye",
"PYE: We would also likely need an enormous space to fit these proposed new energy and warp technologies together. The only location large enough would be <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>.": "Pye",
"RAMIE: The energy is <i>currently</i> unavailable, you say? You’re a gas, Pye!": "Ramie",
"PYE: My pun was unintended, Ramie, so I believe it’s you who’s aeriform!": "Pye",
"PYE: Records show Nomai arriving at the warp receiver on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color> very slightly before departing from the <color=orange>White Hole Station</color>. Ramie and I are devising an experiment to test if this is a real phenomenon or simple machine error.": "Pye",
"RAMIE: In theory, what we want to try to reproduce is a negative amount of time elapsing between something entering the black hole and exiting the white hole at its destination.": "Ramie",
"PYE: Initial things first: Our experiment setup will first pair a small black hole core with a small white hole core to mimic the setup on the <color=orange>White Hole Station</color>.": "Pye",
"RAMIE: Hypothesis: It is possible for an object to exit a white hole before entering the corresponding black hole.": "Ramie",
"RAMIE: An update: Our experiment here reproduced the anomaly in arrival and departure times, but Pye is unconvinced it’s more than an equipment error. I hope to strengthen the effect to render it visible to the unaided eyes.": "Ramie",
"PYE: To that end, we’ve decided to try adding more energy. I imagine the <color=orange>Sunless City</color>’s energy supply should prove sufficient.": "Pye",
"PYE: Of note, Ramie: Yarrow requests that we let him know before we reroute energy to the experiment.": "Pye",
"RAMIE: I’d hate to leave him in the dark!": "Ramie",
"PYE: All available energy has been rerouted from the city to our experiment. Ramie and I are about to run a new test.": "Pye",

"CANNA: To any Nomai clans whose Vessels can hear this message:": "Canna",

"CANNA: If you can reach the Gloaming Galaxy, we’ve found that Blackrock’s suns are fairly stable, and life in this star system is (comparatively) thriving. We live in relative safety.": "Canna",
"CANNA: If you prefer to continue exploring alone, know you will be on your own.": "Canna",
"BROMI: Canna, we’re making our way to you.": "Bromi",
"CANNA: It’s good to hear from you, Bromi! We’ll watch for your Vessel.": "Canna",
"CANNA: Has anyone heard from Neem? His clan was on its way to our Vessel, but they never arrived, and he hasn’t sent any messages. I’m beginning to worry.": "Canna",
"BROMI: That <i>is</i> unsettling. It reminds me of that old myth my grandfather used to tell, the Disappearance of Escall.": "Bromi",
"CLEM: I remember hearing that story as a child! One day, Escall’s <color=orange>Vessel</color> simply stopped responding. The other clans searched and searched, but found no trace. It was as if their missing friends had warped out of existence.": "Clem",
"HYSSOP: That’s no myth, friends; Escall’s clan existed, and their story was real.": "Hyssop",
"BROMI: What a curious event to have passed into myth! Our ancestors’ ancestors were told that story when they were young. Are you sure it’s true, Hyssop?": "Bromi",
"HYSSOP: It was a very long time ago, but yes. My clan’s ancestors searched for Escall’s clan for a long time, but in the end, none of them were ever seen again. (It’s the only time in our history a Vessel has ever disappeared this way.)": "Hyssop",
"NEEM: Hyssop, I hope you aren’t comparing Escall’s story to my clan’s Vessel!": "Neem",
"CLEM: Neem, my friend! We feared you were gone!": "Clem",
"NEEM: Not yet, we aren’t, but nearly. We found trouble during our warp: The triple suns of the Bright Spark star system exploded, and it was only a lucky coincidence we weren’t caught in the blast. We’ll meet you soon, Canna!": "Neem",
"CANNA: I’m relieved your clan is safe, Neem! It’s good to hear your words. Any Vessels nearby, remember to be extremely cautious of potentially unstable stars (which is most of them, now).": "Canna",

"FILIX: We... we are abandoning our <color=orange>Vessel</color>. Any Nomai clans or spaceflight-capable species receiving this message, I implore you, we need your help!": "Filix",
"FILIX: Is this broken? Can anyone hear me? Our <color=orange>Vessel</color> is dying! We need immediate assistance!": "Filix",
"FILIX: I’m recording now — I’ve never encountered anything like this! The signal the <color=orange>Vessel</color> is receiving appears to be <i>older than the universe itself</i>!": "Filix",
"ESCALL: This is our first contact with anything of this nature. Everyone, prepare to warp immediately!": "Escall",
"FILIX: Escall, wait, I need more time to send an outgoing message! Shouldn’t we tell another clan where we’re going?": "Filix",
"ESCALL: We can send the message upon our arrival. This extraordinary signal appeared suddenly; it may disappear just as quickly, and we can’t lose a discovery this incredible! Focus on preparing for the warp, instead.": "Escall",
"FILIX: I understand!": "Filix",
"ESCALL: Annona, is the <color=orange>Vessel</color> ready to warp to the signal’s approximate coordinates?": "Escall",
"ANNONA: The warp core is powered, but this will be a significant jump. Afterward, we’ll need time to recharge the core.": "Annona",
"ESCALL: That shouldn’t create a problem, provided we arrive at or near the signal’s source. Everyone, we’re ready to warp!": "Escall",

"DAZ: If I know my brother, Avens (and his spouse) will want to launch the probe with as much power as possible. I’m worried the cannon would break under the strain.": "Daz",

"THATCH: Where should this new, more sophisticated locator be built? It may need to be larger than this <color=orange>Eye signal locator</color> is.": "Thatch",
"PLUME: The southern glacier on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color> has ample available space. I could construct a new building to house this proposed locator.": "Plume",
"FILIX: Yes, let’s build there! I imagine our young friend Conoy would enjoy that immensely. He’s always held a great interest in the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>, especially for a child born so long after the crash.": "Filix",

"COLEUS: Annona and those of us originally stranded on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color> built a <color=orange>Quantum Moon locator</color> there, but the heat of the <color=lightblue>sun</color> made its construction challenging. I wouldn’t recommend building on that planet.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: After closer observation, mining site 2a wouldn’t be safe for the native life dwelling in some of this cave’s pools, so (unfortunately) we’ll have to mine one of the other sites.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: On the opposite hand, new life! This species is semi-aquatic, and very hardy. The ecosystem here is quite robust, so I believe they’ll thrive in the long run. Be cautious near the pools if you visit 2a to meet them.": "Coleus",
"CYCAD: There are a few other cave sites that look promising. What about site 2b (it shares similar formations and strata)?": "Cycad",
"OENO: This sounds promising! Will you and your mentor investigate? If mining site 2b proves safe for this native species, we’ll move our work there.": "Oeno",

"CYCAD: I was watching them once during a rest, and the hours escaped from me. They’re fascinating (I wonder what their fourth eye does)!": "Cycad",
"COLEUS: They remind me of a subterranean species that my mentor, Melorae, once told me about (from when our clan used to travel across this universe). I imagine she would have enjoyed these lifeforms greatly.": "Coleus",
"CASSAVA: We’re nearly ready! Filix and I have finished construction, and she says calibrating the device won’t take long.": "Cassava",

"COLEUS: We’ve also finished relocating all subterranean plants we met while digging.": "Coleus",
"RAMIE: We’ll need to keep our eyes on how significantly we’ve altered the environment here.": "Ramie",
"PYE: How far we’ve come since our experiments at the <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color>! I still can hardly believe Ramie’s hypothesis was true.": "Pye",
"YARROW: Poke just sent the warp core for the final tower to us from the <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color>. Now <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color> can be connected with <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color>, where Cassava is working with Avens to craft the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color>, and where Phlox is sculpting the memory statues.": "Yarrow",
"CASSAVA: Hypothesis: It was not by accident the core of our warp tower was the last to be forged.": "Cassava",
"POKE: Hypothesis: The cores could have been forged faster if Cassava had interrupted my work less frequently to ask for updates.": "Poke",
"YARROW: The important point is we are all connected through <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color> now, and also that I’m no longer needed for mediating your disagreements.": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: Our friends on <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color> tested the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> today. Mallow tells me the cannon is doing well, and that Avens advocates for more launch power. If anyone can coax the maximum power from a device, Avens can.": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: But then, if anyone can goad a device into exploding, that, too, is likely Avens. Perhaps I should check in with the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> crew in the interest of safety.": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: Would it help to remind Avens that Mallow (his love) will be one of the Nomai aboard the cannon, or is Mallow part of the problem?": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: Pye and Idaea have worked hard on the <color=orange>Sun Station</color>, and it at last is complete. If everything goes as planned, this structure will prompt the <color=lightblue>sun</color>’s explosion, which will in turn supply the power the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> requires.": "Yarrow",
"RAMIE: I’m impressed by their mental fortitude. This was the project’s most difficult task, in more ways than one.": "Ramie",
"YARROW: We’re nearly ready to activate the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>! Here is what will happen: First, the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will receive the order to fire at the <color=lightblue>sun</color>, prompting it to explode.": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: Using the energy from the resulting supernova, the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> will send the order for the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> to fire back in time by 22 minutes.": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: Exactly 22 minutes after these orders are received, the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will again trigger the supernova to send the probe data from this cannon launch back in time.": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: In total, each cycle created by the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> will last precisely 22 minutes. We can end this cycle at will.": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: These words are difficult to write: The <color=orange>Sun Station</color> did not work.": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: However, this is the closest we have ever been. The <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> is theoretically sound; we were only unable to power it. Perhaps there is another way.": "Yarrow",
"PYE: Suppose we redesign the <color=orange>Sun Station</color>. To generate power of that magnitude, a supernova is still our only viable option.": "Pye",
"IDAEA: This is easier expressed than accomplished.": "Idaea",
"PYE: You can wait for the <color=lightblue>sun</color> to explode on its natural timeline if you prefer, Idaea, but you’ll need to find some way to halt our aging process.": "Pye",
"RAMIE: I believe we can still find a way to create a supernova, my friend. Don’t lose hope!": "Ramie",
"YARROW: We are halting our research into creating a supernova for this moment; a <color=lightblue>comet</color> has newly arrived in this solar system, and we’re anxious to explore it.": "Yarrow",
"YARROW: It’s been a very long time since we last explored somewhere new, so we’re excited to welcome this <color=lightblue>comet</color>. Imagine what knowledge might be gained there!": "Yarrow",
"PYE: Friends visiting from the <color=orange>Hanging City</color>, we are planning the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> at the <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color> on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>’s equator.": "Pye",
"CONOY: I became lost on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color> (my gratitude that Ramie found me!), but the <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color> is the building with the large solar panels. I’m suprised I didn’t see it!": "Conoy",

"What is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal?": "Unknown Nomai",
"Suppose the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> wishes to communicate.": "Unknown Nomai",
"The signal is a call. Were we the intended audience?": "Unknown Nomai",
"The signal is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s voice. It speaks a language we don’t yet know.": "Unknown Nomai",
"Or maybe the signal is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s attempt at expressing itself.": "Unknown Nomai",
"Of note: From the signal, we were able to determine the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s approximate age (or perhaps its lack of age?).": "Unknown Nomai",
"Be welcomed in this place. This shrine is a space to reflect on what brought us to this star system: the signal from the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>.": "Unknown Nomai",
"We observed the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal in our travels, and followed it here to find its source.": "Unknown Nomai",
"What we know is this: The source of the signal (which we have chosen to call the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>) is older than this universe itself. The rest, we have yet to learn.": "Unknown Nomai",
"Enter, and open your mind to its possibilities.": "Unknown Nomai",
"Solution 1: We could retrieve the warp core from the <color=orange>Vessel</color>.": "Unknown Nomai",
"RAMIE: The <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s warp core is broken, at best (recall those present when the <color=orange>Vessel</color> crashed said it sustained lethal injuries). There is no guaranteed reward for this risk.": "Ramie",
"CONOY: Perhaps we could still repair it. My grandmother told me there was little time to assess the nature or extent of the damage.": "Conoy",
"CASSAVA: Even if it no longer functions, the old core could be a valuable blueprint, provided we’re able to transport it back here.": "Cassava",
"PHLOX: This would require a return to <color=lightblue>Dark Bramble</color>. Plume (my father) said many good Nomai perished there.": "Phlox",
"CYCAD: My mentor (Coleus) and his old mentor once discovered and studied an anglerfish fossil on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>. Using that knowledge, we could avoid the anglerfish entirely!": "Cycad",
"COLEUS: What Melorae and I learned from that fossil would theoretically help us evade the anglerfish, but our hypothesis was never tested on a live specimen.": "Coleus",
"RAMIE: I remember that anglerfish fossil! We used to play in <color=orange>Fossil Fish Cave</color> when we were children.": "Ramie",
"SOLANUM: I no longer believe, as I did as a child on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>, that the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color> (the source of the signal) wishes to harm us. But it may not want to be found, either.": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: The terrible circumstances of our arrival here were almost certainly exactly that: circumstance.": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: I suspect imagining we are special to the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> in some way is wishful thinking. The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> might have called out to any sentient species.": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: Or it might not have been calling out at all, and that my ancestors heard the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal holds no great, deep meaning.": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: This wouldn’t be so bad, I think.": "Solanum",
"SOLANUM: In fact, the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> may not have wishes at all. We have no evidence supporting this.": "Solanum",
"ILEX: Why We Should Build A New Vessel": "Ilex",
"ILEX: Each Nomai clan explores the universe in its own Vessel. The Vessel is the heart of every clan.": "Ilex",
"ILEX: It’s unusual for Nomai to remain in one place for so long. Nomai are wanderers and have no permanent home.": "Ilex",
"ILEX: If we built a new Vessel, we could return to our adventurous way of life. Imagine all the new places we could go! Our clan wouldn’t be stuck here in this star system.": "Ilex",
"ILEX: We could even meet with other Nomai, and learn from them, like Coleus says we used to do.": "Ilex",
"ILEX: It probably wouldn’t be hard to get parts if we stopped building other new things, and if we broke down other structures (like the towers on <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>) for parts.": "Ilex",
"ILEX: We might have to build a smaller Vessel for now, even though Vessels are normally large. But we could make it bigger later once we reach planets with more resources.": "Ilex",
"ILEX: It would also help if we stopped building so many things to search for the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>. I asked Yarrow, and he says we use lots of resources on the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>.": "Ilex",
"ILEX: We could even have a warp core for jumping long distances like Vessels have. Poke tells me she plans to make a very advanced warp core for a different project. I’m sure she could connect it to the Vessel for travel (because Poke is smart).": "Ilex",
"THATCH: Is everyone unharmed?": "Thatch",
"PLUME: No one was badly injured from the <color=orange>escape pod’s</color> impact. We’re incredibly fortunate.": "Plume",
"THATCH: This is good news, at least. Have we heard from <color=orange>Escape Pod 2</color> or <color=orange>Escape Pod 3</color>?": "Thatch",
"FILIX: No, I... I’m unable to make contact. My equipment can hear the other two escape pods’ distress signals, however. If it’s any comfort, both pods must be structurally intact.": "Filix",
"FILIX: I’ll continue calling for them.": "Filix",
"THATCH: My gratitude. If we can —": "Thatch",
"PLUME: Thatch, the moon is approaching again!": "Plume",

"THATCH: Be cautious of falling ash and debris!": "Thatch",
"PLUME: ...I believe the moon has passed.": "Plume",
"FILIX: This planet doesn’t appear eager to have guests. We are certainly unwelcome on its surface.": "Filix",
"THATCH: We need to find shelter, and quickly. The <color=lightblue>volcanic moon</color> won’t be gone for long.": "Thatch",
"PLUME: I observed several promising sites below the surface, but we’ll need to construct a way for everyone to climb safely down this cliff. Perhaps we could build platforms?": "Plume",
"CONOY: What have we learned thus far in our search for the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>?": "Conoy",
"PLUME: Those of us on the <color=orange>Vessel</color> originally followed the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal to this star system, but we were unable to warp to the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> itself.": "Plume",
"PRIVET: The locator we built on the <color=lightblue>Attlerock</color> and the new, more sensitive locator we built here were both unable to detect any trace of the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal.": "Privet",
"AVENS: Hypothesis: The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> has stopped emitting its signal.": "Avens",
"CASSAVA: Suppose the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> doesn’t wish to be found.": "Cassava",
"PLUME: Cassava, how can you suggest that? The <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal called out to summon us to this star system!": "Plume",
"CASSAVA: I’m aware; I grew up hearing the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s story. Yet we’re no closer to finding it than you were when you first arrived here.": "Cassava",
"MALLOW: Based on our knowledge of the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>, we believe the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is in orbit around this star system’s <color=lightblue>sun</color>. This would mean the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is located within a finite (albeit enormous) range.": "Mallow",
"CONOY: How should our methods change as we continue our search for the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>?": "Conoy",
"PRIVET: As we couldn’t find the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal using two different devices built for this exact purpose, we should discontinue this search method.": "Privet",
"MALLOW: We know what the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> looks like thanks to the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>, so what if we try to find the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> visually, instead? Let’s send out a probe!": "Mallow",
"CASSAVA: Mallow’s idea is clever, but we have no idea where the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is in relation to here. The probability of launching a probe in the correct direction would be absurdly small.": "Cassava",

"MELORAE: This is my first time encountering a natural satellite with the ability to vanish when not being watched. We should study it! Or, even better, we should travel there!": "Melorae",
"BUR: I agree! Our first step would be determining a method to track this <color=lightblue>phantom moon</color> so that we can always know where it is.": "Bur",

"COLEUS: How curious! This rock took me with it to a new location. I wonder why this happened?": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: Curious, but also alarming: This new cave appears to lack an entrance or exit. Also, the rock that brought me here disappeared while I wasn’t watching.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: The wandering rock has returned! Never before have I been so delighted to see a sedimentary specimen.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: I wonder if I myself became quantum briefly when the rock carried me here! This seems the clearest explanation. Hypothesis: If the rock can bring me here, it can also carry me out.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: My hypothesis was correct! I can travel on this rock, as long as I’m not observing my surroundings (meaning I must be in complete darkness). I’m going to bring my mentor here to see this.": "Coleus",
"COLEUS: Melorae is here now, too. We theorize when a conscious being is in contact with a quantum object and ceases to observe his or her surroundings, the being can become entangled with that quantum object, and they move together.": "Coleus",
"MELORAE: Friends, Coleus has discovered a new quantum rule! (He has also promised me he’ll never vanish again, even if he <i>does</i> learn something useful from it!)": "Melorae",

"Tektite5Maybe I’d better grab an extra axe or three, just in case.": "Tektite",

"RiebeckLearned_4You visited the Hanging City? Oh gosh, how was it? Was it amazing? Was it beautiful? ...Was it scary?": "Riebeck",
"RiebeckLearned_4The Hanging City is where the Nomai settled permanently on Brittle Hollow. It was their most advanced settlement here!": "Riebeck",
"RiebeckLearned_4Why they chose to build their most advanced settlement so close to a <i>you-know-what</i> is beyond me. Maybe that kind of thing makes sense to a Nomai, though. ...Maybe they needed the <size=20>black hole</size> for something?": "Riebeck",
"RiebeckLearned_5You mean there’s another Nomai city <i>inside</i> of Ember Twin? That’s incredible! A whole city, and I had no idea it existed! This is great!": "Riebeck",
"RiebeckLearned_5How did they keep the sand out? If it were me, I’d be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand. Gosh, the Nomai sure were ingenius, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City! ...Wow!": "Riebeck",
"RiebeckLearned_5That means there were two groups of Nomai — one that lived on Ember Twin, and one that lived here on Brittle Hollow. But they must have traveled around the solar system, since Nomai writing can be found on other planets, too.": "Riebeck",
"RiebeckLearned_6A pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon? The Nomai mentioned the Quantum Moon in a lot of their writing, so it was clearly special to them. And um, special enough to make a trip there by themselves!": "Riebeck",
"RiebeckLearned_6It sounds like a coming-of-age ritual, like how hatchlings stay hatchlings until their stomachs are strong enough to drink sap wine.": "Riebeck",
"RiebeckLearned_6Maybe once a Nomai journeyed to the Quantum Moon, they were considered an adult?": "Riebeck",
"RiebeckLearned_7Oh, wow. <i>Wow.</i> So that’s how the Nomai died?": "Riebeck",

"SOLANUM: Given the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color> is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s moon, it’s likely that any characteristics the moon exhibits are also exhibited by the Eye itself. The <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color> and its shards, for instance, are quantum; thus, the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is likely also quantum.": "Solanum",

"SOLANUM: Because the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color> clearly changes in its different forms, the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> (being this moon’s primary location) must be similarly malleable.": "Solanum",

"Chert2You’ll find Nomai ruins across the Twins, but, strangely, not a single settlement! Believe me, if there was one to see, I’d have seen it with my Little Scout.": "Chert",
"Chert2So where did they live? Not on the surface, clearly. Ember Twin is full of cave systems, though - maybe the answer lies underground?": "Chert",
"Chert3On a scale of one to dead, I’d give it a seven or eight. Awfully pretty, though.": "Chert",
"Chert3Right now sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin, but did you know the process eventually reverses? We're not completely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the Twins, but it seems to be a natural phenomena.": "Chert",

"FoundSomething2The planet I mentioned may have been frozen solid, or just partially made of ice, like a much colder Giant’s Deep - it’s hard to say. It used to be the fifth planet in our solar system.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething2You’ll notice, of course, that there’s no such planet now. In its place is Dark Bramble, which - how to put this - grew into the space the fifth planet used to occupy.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething2That is, Dark Bramble quite literally appeared at the center of the fifth planet and began destroying it from the inside-out. Eventually, the planet shattered completely, and its shards were flung across space.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething2Some of these shards collided with the celestial bodies in our solar system, such as the Attlerock, which I believe is how its biggest crater was formed.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething3How fascinating! It might interest you to know the existence of an additional planet is entirely plausible, if you look at the physics of our solar system. It would just have to be incredibly far out there - farther than Hearthian ships would be able to travel.": "Chert",

"FoundSomething5Is that what’s in orbit around the sun, then, do you think? This... Sun Station?": "Chert",
"FoundSomething5Quite clever of the Nomai to devise a way to study the sun up close and personal! It must have been tremendously difficult to construct. ...And hot inside. I can only imagine!": "Chert",

"Chert2bYou’ll find Nomai ruins across the Twins, but, strangely, not a single settlement! Believe me, if there was one to see, I’d have seen it with my Little Scout.": "Chert",
"Chert2bSo where did they live? Not on the surface, clearly. Ember Twin is full of cave systems, though - maybe the answer lies underground?": "Chert",
"Chert3bOn a scale of one to dead, I’d give it a seven or eight. Awfully pretty, though.": "Chert",
"Chert3bRight now sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin, but did you know the process eventually reverses? We're not completely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the Twins, but it seems to be a natural phenomena.": "Chert",
"Chert3bOh, if you’d like to see something interesting, check out the other Twin once a little more of its sand drains off. I promise you won’t be disappointed.": "Chert",
"Chert4I have no idea! Massive stars go supernova when they reach the end of their life spans, so it's possible that the stars are older than we realized. Or maybe our models are wrong and they don't live as long as we expected.": "Chert",
"Chert4Honestly, I'm not fond of either option! If our charts are wrong, what else is wrong? And our sun...": "Chert",
"Chert4No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I- I'm probably overlooking something. That's it, I just need to collect more data.": "Chert",
"Chert5Watch out for the stars. I mean, sand.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething1bWhat? What makes you think that?": "Chert",
"FoundSomething1bIt’s true the sun has... <i>changed</i>, lately, but I’ve not seen any evidence suggesting the approaching death of our sun! Stars above, no!": "Chert",
"FoundSomething1bI’ll tell you what, though - I’ll keep my eyes on the sun, and if I find any suggestion the its core is collapsing, you shall be the first to know.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething1bI hope that puts your mind at ease.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething2bDid you! I hope they were useful?": "Chert",
"FoundSomething2bThe planet I mentioned may have been frozen solid, or just partially made of ice, like a much colder Giant’s Deep - it’s hard to say. It used to be the fifth planet in our solar system.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething2bYou’ll notice, of course, that there’s no such planet now. In its place is Dark Bramble, which - how to put this - grew into the space the fifth planet used to occupy.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething2bThat is, Dark Bramble quite literally appeared at the center of the fifth planet and began destroying it from the inside-out. Eventually, the planet shattered completely, and its shards were flung across space.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething2bSome of these shards collided with the celestial bodies in our solar system, such as the Attlerock, which I believe is how its biggest crater was formed.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething3bHow fascinating! It might interest you to know the existence of an additional planet is entirely plausible, if you look at the physics of our solar system. It would just have to be incredibly far out there - farther than Hearthian ships would be able to travel.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething3bAnd honestly, we don’t know all that much about what’s all out there. The farther you go, the less we know! As such, it’s well within the realm of possibility such a planet exists.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething4bOh yes, everyone loves a good mystery, don’t they? Who wouldn’t wonder about a moon that’s sometimes there and sometimes not!": "Chert",
"FoundSomething4bI’ve observed the Quantum Moon orbiting each of the five planets, but sometimes, it quite simply disappears from the sky altogether. Maybe there’s another place it travels to!": "Chert",
"FoundSomething4bUnfortunately, if there is, I’ve never seen it. Perhaps if I take a closer look at these star charts...": "Chert",
"FoundSomething5bIs that what’s in orbit around the sun, then, do you think? This... Sun Station?": "Chert",
"FoundSomething5bQuite clever of the Nomai to devise a way to study the sun up close and personal! It must have been tremendously difficult to construct. ...And hot inside. I can only imagine!": "Chert",
"FoundSomething5bI wonder how were they able to travel back and forth from the Sun Station and the Hourglass Twins, when the slightest slip up would have meant a fiery death.": "Chert",
"FoundSomething6bYou - what? I don’t... um. What?": "Chert",
"FoundSomething6bYou mean to say there are modern Nomai out in other parts of space? And they believe the universe - all of it, the whole thing - is dying? <Pause/>Currently? <Pause/>...Right now?": "Chert",
"FoundSomething6bIf... if that’s true, how could I have missed so many signs? The supernovae were there, but I, but, I’ve been studying the stars for... well, what does it matter if... oh...": "Chert",
"FoundSomething6bI’m very sorry, b-but I have to look over my charts. I h-h-hope you don’t m-mind...": "Chert",
"ChertBreakdownNomaibB-b-but surely, I would have seen some kind of other sign than the supernovae, so p-perhaps...?": "Chert",
"FoundSomething7bNothing you’d like to discuss at the moment? That’s no trouble! If you do find something you wish to discuss, please, come find me! I’ll be here studying the stars for a while yet.": "Chert",
"ChertIntroThe stars! They're all dying! There’ve been too many supernovae for it to be anything else!": "Chert",

"ChertNextThe star charts! Why? Why did I want to update them so badly? I didn’t have to know, but no, oh no, I had to update the star charts! I had to go looking for things I shouldn’t have! And now our sun is about to... about to... oh...": "Chert",
"ChertNext...I don’t feel well. I’d like to be alone, please.": "Chert",
"FoundSomethingWhy, isn’t that great! Do you know what, I’ve found a few things myself! Most of them have to do with the sun exploding!": "Chert",

"ThisPlanet_2T...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there.": "Gabbro",

"Curator1There you are! I just finished pre-flight observations, and local conditions are good. Time to get our newest astronaut off the ground!": "Hornfels",

"Curator2I might have guessed as much! No sense in making a translator tool if you’re not going to use it to translate anything.": "Hornfels",
"Curator2We’ve barely scratched the surface of the Nomai writing in our solar system, so we still know very little about them. We’ve no idea if they originated here or traveled here, or why they disappeared.": "Hornfels",
"Curator2That tool of yours should prove indispensible in solving the mystery of this ancient species!": "Hornfels",
"Curator3You’re going to check in with them, are you? Not a bad plan - no one knows the solar system better than our astronauts.": "Hornfels",
"Curator3Let’s see... Chert is on the Hourglass Twins, Riebeck is on Brittle Hollow, and Gabbro is on Giant’s Deep, last I checked.": "Hornfels",

"Curator3Feldspar has been lost for a very long time, I’m afraid.": "Hornfels",
"Curator3...On a more cheerful note, you’ll find Esker stationed on the Attlerock. They’re not a traveler so much as a lunar local, but I’m sure they’d appreciate a visit nevertheless.": "Hornfels",
"Curator4I like it! You’ll have plenty of options to choose from.": "Hornfels",
"Curator4No one’s ever landed on the Interloper before, you know. Perhaps you’ll be the first?": "Hornfels",
"Curator4I must say... Should you choose to go to Dark Bramble, be <i>very</i> careful. No one’s explored there before, either, for what you’ll find are excellent reasons.": "Hornfels",
"Curator5You’d prefer to ease into things? That’s a sensible plan! More sensible than most of our astronauts tend to be, and that’s a fact.": "Hornfels",
"Curator5Do you think you’ll go to the Attlerock, then? Our moon would be a safe place to travel to and get your bearings in space, and I’m sure Esker would appreciate the visit.": "Hornfels",
"Curator5Plus, we don’t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!": "Hornfels",
"Curator6Haha! Overwhelmed by the options, perhaps? I don’t blame you.": "Hornfels",
"Curator6If you need help getting started, you could go visit Esker on the moon. They’re alone on the Attlerock most of the time, so I’m sure they’d appreciate it.": "Hornfels",
"Curator6Plus, we don’t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!": "Hornfels",
"Curator7Planning to follow in the footsteps of Feldspar and the great Outer Wilds Ventures tradition, are you? I might have guessed.": "Hornfels",
"Curator7Well, see if you can’t put that translator tool of yours to good use while you’re out there!": "Hornfels",
"Curator8Well then, looks like all that’s left is to send you off! All in all, it’s a fine day for a launch!": "Hornfels",

"Curator10I’m not one for superstition, but isn’t that kind of unlucky to say before a launch?": "Hornfels",

"CuratorMoreAboutFeldsparTest-piloted everything Slate ever built! It’s a wonder Feldspar lived to see space, frankly, but they did. Flew all sorts of dangerous stunts and explored everything they could find.": "Hornfels",

"CuratorFeldsparFoundYou found Feldspar?! And they’re in Dark Bramble?! Stars above, this is wonderful news! Thank you! Thank you for finding them!": "Hornfels",
"CuratorFeldsparFoundThat Feldspar didn’t immediately join you on your ship and return here is incredibly Feldspar of them. We were never entirely sure what Feldspar was thinking back then, either.": "Hornfels",
"CuratorFeldsparFoundStill, we ought to fish them out of that dreadful place with all haste! I’ll radio Gossan and have them prepare a ship. It really should be Gossan who brings Feldspar home.": "Hornfels",
