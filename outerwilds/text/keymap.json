"Solution 2: We could craft a new advanced warp core inspired by the <color=orange>Vessel</color>\u2019s warp core.": 6,
"OENO: The greatest challenge here, I think, is we don\u2019t have the design for such a powerful core, or any of the original crafters of the <color=orange>Vessel</color>\u2019s core.": 7,
"CLARY: No, but Poke was apprenticed to Annona, who created the original design, and our <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color> is adept at crafting simpler cores.": 8,
"POKE: I believe I can be of use here! The <color=orange>Vessel</color>\u2019s warp core was created before my time, but Annona explained many of his designs to me.": 9,
"IDAEA: This is the safest path for our clan.": 10,
"AVENS: Is the safest path the best one? Our goal is worth the risk.": 11,
"CASSAVA: Is it, though? We\u2019ve tried for so long to find something that I (and others) now believe might be impossible to find. If the search for the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is a futile one, we should choose the option with the least potential for harm.": 12,
"SPIRE: Abandoning the <color=orange>Vessel</color>\u2019s warp core and its casing means losing valuable knowledge.": 13,
"MITIS: This is true; however, it\u2019s knowledge we have little hope of recovering. It would be best to relearn, I think.": 14,
"POKE: I would very much like to craft such a powerful core! More relevantly, I believe the <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color> crew and I could recreate the basic design.": 15,
"CASSAVA: I imagine I\u2019ve been hard on Poke, again. This in turn means I\u2019ve made things difficult for her sister (Clary).": 16,
"CASSAVA: If Poke and I are oil and water, Clary is our emulsifier. She certainly makes us a better team than would mixing through shaking (although sometimes I would like to shake Poke!).": 17,
"CASSAVA: Jokes aside, suppose my own fear of never finding the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> prompted my argument with Poke. That would be immature of me.": 18,
"CASSAVA: I should apologize... At least to Clary, who could then tell Poke.": 19,
"POKE: I feel strange, trying to recreate Annona\u2019s warp core without him. At times, it still feels strange to no longer be his (very young) apprentice, and for the <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color> to be in my care and not his.": 20,
"POKE: Hypothesis: This will always feel strange. Even though my time with him was short, I miss my old mentor, and deeply.": 21,
"POKE: To have the chance to try is thrilling, but... I don\u2019t want to disappoint everyone. I <i>think</i> I can do this (probably), but what if excitement has clouded my assessment of my own abilities?": 22,
"POKE: Was I wrong in volunteering to build it...? I was born in this star system, and never saw Annona\u2019s warp core with my own three eyes. I only know what he taught me. What if I\u2019ve bitten off a larger portion than I can consume?": 23,
"POKE: Still, all I can give is my best. And as Annona would say, should my best prove insufficient, then we will find another way to achieve what\u2019s needed. I have Clary and Root in the forge, and I have my clan. I am not alone!": 24,
"SOLANUM: Formation Of This Universe": 25,
"SOLANUM: No one knows how this universe was made, but one thing we do know is everything used to be very hot and very dense (tightly packed together).": 26,
"SOLANUM: As this early universe expanded, it also cooled down. Once it had cooled down enough, particles were able to group together to form things like galaxies, stars, and planets!": 27,
"SOLANUM: Since then, space has continued to expand at a faster and faster rate, which is hard to think about for too long without your brain hurting.": 28,
"SOLANUM: This universe will keep getting colder and larger, until one day, the stars and the life they support will all die.": 29,
"SOLANUM: That\u2019s scary to think about, even though Conoy tells me it won\u2019t happen in our lifetimes. But it\u2019ll happen in someone else\u2019s, someday!": 30,

"CONOY: Spire and I are crafting a model to determine why this happened.": 45,
"SPIRE: An update: It\u2019s now clear there are two different types of cyclone.": 46,

"BELLS: These Nomai looked upward from two different planets and saw the same wandering moon visiting their skies. It was this moon (the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>) that kept their curiosity alive during this long period of hardship.": 67,
"BELLS: After the two divided groups were able to reunite, it became our clan\u2019s united goal to find and visit the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>. This took time, and many Nomai who dreamed of seeing the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color> died before we discovered how to make the journey.": 68,

"THATCH: Plume is right; the trees <i>do</i> move! I confess I didn\u2019t notice until I read his notes.": 72,
"THATCH: Alarmingly, it isn\u2019t only the trees: There is other matter in this area (such as that unusual shard of rock) moving in this same eerie way.": 73,

"THATCH: Plume, Filix, and I have determined this atypical shard of rock is the reason objects in this grove are behaving in a quantum manner.": 76,
"THATCH: The only other object we\u2019ve observed displaying this quantum behavior is the <color=lightblue>wandering moon</color>. I imagine the moon\u2019s behavior and this grove\u2019s are related.": 77,
"PLUME: In her note from earlier, Filix mentions this strange type of rock isn\u2019t found elsewhere on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>. What if it isn\u2019t originally from this planet?": 78,
"PLUME: Hypothesis: This \u201cquantum shard\u201d is from the <color=lightblue>wandering (quantum) moon</color>. Perhaps it is even a small piece of the moon itself.": 79,
"FILIX: Of note: A unique signal is coming from this shard! Curiously, our friend the <color=lightblue>wandering moon</color> sounds the same.": 80,
"FILIX: I\u2019ve also heard the same signal this shard produces calling out from <color=lightblue>Giant\u2019s Deep</color>,<color=lightblue>Timber Hearth</color>, and the <color=lightblue>Hourglass Twins</color>. Suppose there are other shards like this one!": 81,

"MELORAE: When our <color=orange>escape pod</color> punctured this planet\u2019s surface, it broke into what scans show is a cave system with much cooler air. I <i>would</i> recommend we seek a site down there to build a long-term shelter, Annona, but these passages are a maze!": 104,
"ANNONA: Even with this danger, they are still our best chance for survival. We\u2019ll form teams and descend into the caves to look for a shelter site. We can mark our findings on the walls to avoid becoming irreversibly lost.": 105,
"ANNONA: Be cautious, everyone.": 106,
"RHUS: And be aware of the sand as you search. It appears to be rising gradually.": 107,
"COLEUS: The path to the shelter site is somewhat convoluted, so follow the instructions ahead closely!": 108,
"COLEUS: To reach the shelter site, walk forward until you meet the sandfall at the pit, then turn left. Continue to the room filled with rock column formations and climb upward through the opening above them.": 109,
"COLEUS: The sand here is rising, so you must be cautious but swift.": 110,
"COLEUS: Be cautious crossing the chasm ahead. The bridge Melorae and I crafted will do its job, but it isn\u2019t strong.": 111,
"COLEUS: Once on the far side, look for the tunnel hidden behind the falling sand. Follow it, and you\u2019ll reach the shelter site.": 112,
"COLEUS: You\u2019re doing well! There\u2019s only a little farther left to go now until you reach the shelter site. You can rest there. Hurry, before the sand comes!": 113,
"MELORAE: Do not follow this tunnel to its end! (Coleus and I will examine the horror that lies at its terminus later, provided we live through this.)": 114,
"ANNONA: Of note: This passage leads to breathable air. Refill your supply tank there (we cannot tell how far or deep these tunnels may wind), but do not linger, as the area is exposed to the heat of this alien <color=lightblue>sun</color>.": 115,
"ANNONA: Refill your air supply tank and return quickly.": 116,

"POKE: ...Pye. Whatever the matter inside this stone casing is, it\u2019s more than just profoundly unstable; it\u2019s under tonnes of pressure. Look at this density scan. I\u2019ve never seen <i>anything</i> this tightly compacted before! What <i>is</i> this?": 147,
"PYE: This is orders of magnitude worse than I\u2019d imagined. If this stone were to rupture, the lethal matter within would rapidly expand, completely blanketing this star system almost instantaneously.

"PYE: The more we know about this alien matter, the better our chances of survival. I will learn what I can here. Go, warn the others; maybe they can construct shelter somehow. ...<i>Now</i>, Poke!": 151,
"CLARY: I fear our situation may be dire:": 152,
"CLARY: Pye, Poke, and I landed here on this <color=lightblue>comet</color> not long after its arrival in this star system. Our <color=orange>shuttle</color>\u2019s equipment heard strange energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface.": 153,
"CLARY: Pye and Poke were able to locate a fissure in the ice on the <color=lightblue>comet</color>\u2019s sunward side, and they descended inside to investigate the source of the readings.": 154,
"CLARY: But... Pye and my sister have been gone for a long time now. They haven\u2019t contacted me since descending below the surface, either.": 155,
"CLARY: Should I leave the <color=orange>shuttle</color> to look for them? I want to follow protocol, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if they aren\u2019t well...": 156,
"CLARY: Poke... Pye... Come back to me safely, my friends.": 157,
"CLARY: This is troublesome: It seems the <color=lightblue>comet</color> wishes to submerge our <color=orange>shuttle</color> in ice. If we stay on the surface too long, the <color=orange>shuttle</color> may freeze entirely.": 158,
"POKE: Even if it did, couldn\u2019t someone call it back home to the <color=orange>gravity cannon</color> on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>?": 159,
"PYE: Yes, but the exploration of the <color=lightblue>comet</color> would be more difficult if we were without the <color=orange>shuttle</color> until someone recalled it. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have landed on the dark side of the <color=lightblue>comet</color>...": 160,
"CLARY: Suppose one of us remained in the <color=orange>shuttle</color> to keep it warm and continue monitoring the surface.": 161,

"Gabbro3F_5It looks like you and I are the only ones who can tell that time\u2019s gone all weird. I tried radioing Hornfels and asking if they\u2019d died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical.": 377,
"Gabbro3F_5Even if I tell Hornfels about the time loop, they never remember by the next one. They don\u2019t realize anything\u2019s different.": 378,
"Gabbro3F_5And here\u2019s another weird one for you - every time I die, all of my memories from that loop replay back to me. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s related to this big stone Nomai statue I found on one of the other islands.": 379,
"Gabbro3F_5I was looking at it, and the statue opened its eyes and started glowing. It replayed my memories like it\u2019d seen them through my own eyes, just like what happens each time I die.": 380,
"GabbroGabbro3F_5That happened to me with the statue at the museum.": 381,
"Gabbro3F_6You too, huh? Then the Nomai statues must have something to do with why we\u2019re the only ones aware of the time loop. So... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?": 382,

"WhereToExplore_3FI was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It\u2019s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale.": 401,
"WhereToExplore_3FIf you feel like checking out Statue Island, it\u2019s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You\u2019ll see.": 402,
"ThisPlanet_3FHaha, I know, right?": 403,
"ThisPlanet_3F...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant\u2019s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there.": 404,
"ThisPlanet_3FThere\u2019s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.": 405,
"ThisPlanet_3FAs for land masses, I\u2019ve counted four islands, including this one. There\u2019s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach.": 406,
"ThisPlanet_3FYou\u2019ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they\u2019re hard to miss. They\u2019ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip \u2014 if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you.": 407,
"GabbrosShipThat\u2019s a good question.": 408,
"GabbrosShipIt\u2019s definitely on this planet <i>some</i>where. I mean, unless a cyclone came by and tossed it into space, I guess. Heh, that would be pretty nuts.": 409,

"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found Nomai masks inside the Ash Twin Project.": 420,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found what happened to the Orbital Probe Cannon.": 421,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found your quantum poem.": 422,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found a photo of you inside the old radio tower.": 423,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuActually, nevermind.": 424,
"FoundSomething1_3FSo the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing.": 425,
"FoundSomething1_3FDo you think the statues are recording our memories, then? \u2019Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!": 426,
"FoundSomething1bRight, right, the cavern inside Statue Island is where the memory-recording statues were made, I remember.": 427,
"FoundSomething1bSo your memory statue is the one in the museum back in the crater, and mine\u2019s the one I found on the beach. I kinda dig having my own personal memory-friend.": 428,
"FoundSomething1bIf you come up with any hunches about what the Nomai wanted to record memories for, feel free to run them by me! You know where I\u2019ll be.": 429,
"FoundSomething2_3FWait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is <i>wild</i>.": 430,
"FoundSomething2_3FNow we know what\u2019s causing the loop, then. And... if it\u2019s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh...": 431,
"FoundSomething2_3FHey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there\u2019s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn\u2019t, what with the sun blowing up and all.": 432,
"FoundSomething2_3FThen again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?": 433,
"FoundSomething2_3F...I dunno, I\u2019m no time loop expert. I\u2019m just gonna sit here and ponder the intricacies of time and space. Maybe take a nap, too, if I feel like it.": 434,
"FoundSomething2bMy head\u2019s still all full of scenarios for what would happen if you turned off the time loop. I\u2019ll probably notice if you decide to mess with it, though, right? Seems like something I\u2019d notice.": 435,
"FoundSomething2bThis is all pretty wild.": 436,
"FoundSomething3_3FYou\u2019re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we\u2019ve gone through.": 437,
"FoundSomething3_3FWait, then it\u2019s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?": 438,
"FoundSomething3_3FThat\u2019s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven\u2019t, because technically the loops never happened.": 439,
"FoundSomething3_3FMeaning we\u2019re receiving memories of things that will never happen to us. Cool, huh?": 440,
"FoundSomething3bRight, you told me earlier that the point of the statues is to send memories back in time. Which I guess makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we\u2019ve gone through.": 441,
"FoundSomething3bI thought about it some more, and I think that means our minds have gone through all these loops, but we haven\u2019t actually gone through them ourselves.": 442,

"FoundSomething4FollowUp_3FCome to think of it, though, \u201cbroke\u201d might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop.": 449,
"FoundSomething4b_3FSo the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I\u2019m seeing fall from the sky every loop.": 450,

"FoundSomething6BaseNice. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy.": 456,
"FoundSomething6Must have been from the time Hornfels sent me to check on the deep space satellite. They thought Ol\u2019 Spacey might be malfunctioning, but I couldn\u2019t find a single thing wrong with it.": 457,
"FoundSomething6Which is probably how it got a shot of my beautiful be-helmeted face, come to think of it.": 458,
"FoundSomething6I always thought it was kinda sweet that the best way to find Ol\u2019 Spacey is to use a map that\u2019s generated by the satellite itself, isn\u2019t it? Like it\u2019s inviting us to visit. Good ol\u2019 deep space satellite, always making sure we know where we\u2019re going.": 459,
"GabbroFoundSomething6Why\u2019d Hornfels think it was broken?": 460,
"GabbroFoundSomething6Um. \u201cOl\u2019 Spacey\u201d?": 461,
"GabbroFoundSomething6I have a map?!": 462,
"FoundSomething6aDunno. Hornfels probably told me why, but Hornfels tells me lots of things, and sometimes I tune out. Or pretend there\u2019s signal interference and I can\u2019t hear them.": 463,
"FoundSomething6aBest guess says the deep space satellite must have sent Timber Hearth some weird pictures, but like\u2026 what\u2019s considered \u201cweird\u201d for a satellite, you know?": 464,
"FoundSomething6aAnyway, if you ever want to visit Ol\u2019 Spacey, fastest way is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to the satellite, same as you would any astral body.": 465,
"FoundSomething6bI mean, the satellite\u2019s not <i>super</i> old, but it\u2019s hardly brand-new. \u201cOl\u2019\u201d is more a term of affection. ...You\u2019re being very literal-minded about this.": 466,
"FoundSomething6bOl\u2019 Spacey likes visitors, you know! Fastest way to find it is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to our faithful satellite friend, same as you would any astral body.": 467,
"FoundSomething6cYeah, um, the one that\u2019s standard with all our spacesuits? The one you have with you at all times that opens with the press of a button? \u2026That map?": 468,
"FoundSomething6cYou didn\u2019t get conked on the head by a rock or a meteorite or something on your way here, did you? No shame in that. Happens to me all the time!": 469,
"FoundSomething6cIn case you were hit especially hard, don\u2019t forget that you can jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to any astral body. It\u2019s the easiest way to visit Ol\u2019 Spacey, too.": 470,
"FoundSomethingExitNo worries. Feel free to let me know when you do find something cool, though. You know where to find me.": 471,
"Gabbro3T_1I was hoping you\u2019d be back - something <i>really</i> weird is going on.": 472,
"GabbroGabbro3T_1Do you think we\u2019re in a time loop?": 473,
"GabbroGabbro3T_1We\u2019re definitely in a time loop.": 474,
"Gabbro3T_2Yeah, a time loop makes the most sense, right? Or at least, it\u2019s some kind of fidgety time business. Hard to say what\u2019s happening to the shape of time, exactly, but let\u2019s go with \u201cloop\u201d for now.": 475,
"Gabbro3T_3Oh. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool.": 476,
"GabbroGabbro3T_3You\u2019re taking this pretty well.": 477,
"GabbroGabbro3T_3What did you think it was?": 478,
"Gabbro3T_4Heh, right back at you. Personally, I like new experiences, and I\u2019ve never been in a time loop before.": 479,
"Gabbro3T_4Well. I don\u2019t <i>think</i> I\u2019ve been in a time loop before this one, but then, it\u2019s not like I can know that for sure.": 480,
"Gabbro3T_5I figured it\u2019d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn\u2019t really thinking about what\u2019s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let\u2019s go with \u201cloop\u201d for now.": 481,
"Gabbro3T_6So it looks like you and I are the only ones who know we\u2019re in a time loop. And even if you tell them about it, no one remembers by the next loop. What\u2019s with that?": 482,
"Gabbro3T_6Maybe it\u2019s because we both made some seriously intense eye contact with a Nomai statue?": 483,
"Gabbro3T_6I\u2019m seeing my memories replay each time I die, just like I did when the Nomai statue on the beach opened its eyes and looked at me. So maybe... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?": 484,
"Gabbro3T_6I think that\u2019s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I\u2019ll be here.": 485,
"Gabbro3T_SecondaryHey, my time buddy\u2019s back!": 486,
"GabbroMenuSo what\u2019s new?": 487,
"WhatAreYouDoing_3TWell, what are any of us doing here, really?": 488,
"WhatAreYouDoing_3T...Nah, I\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.": 489,
"WhatAreYouDoing_3TBut I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It\u2019s quiet and peaceful out here.": 490,

"WhereToExplore_3THere\u2019s something you might like \u2014 I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky at the start of every loop. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet.": 492,
"WhereToExplore_3TWhat else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been calling it, seeing as it\u2019s the <i>island</i> where I found the glowing Nomai <i>statue</i>.<Pause> ...Get it?": 493,
"WhereToExplore_3TI was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It\u2019s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale.": 494,

"ThisPlanet_3TYou\u2019ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they\u2019re hard to miss. They\u2019ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip - if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you.": 500,
"FoundSomething1_3TSo the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing.": 501,
"FoundSomething1_3TDo you think the statues are recording our memories, then? \u2019Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!": 502,
"FoundSomething2_3TWait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is <i>wild</i>.": 503,
"FoundSomething2_3TNow we know what\u2019s causing the loop, then. And... if it\u2019s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh...": 504,
"FoundSomething2_3THey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there\u2019s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn\u2019t, what with the sun blowing up and all.": 505,
"FoundSomething2_3TThen again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?": 506,

"ScientistAnswer33I won\u2019t ask how you got the codes, so hurry up and launch before Hornfels decides to ground you for medical reasons.  I want to see whether the new cockpit stays attached during liftoff.": 635,

"ScientistAnswer37Had an exciting dream, did you?": 648,
"ScientistAnswer37It\u2019s not exactly <i>impossible</i> for the autopilot to get you too close to the sun, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019ll try to take you there on purpose.": 649,
"ScientistAnswer37Make sure the sun isn\u2019t between you and your destination when you engage autopilot, and you\u2019ll be fine.": 650,
"ScientistAnswer38Use your scout to detect it, you dumb idiot! Did you think I made that just so you could take pretty little pictures of trees? It has multiple uses!": 651,
"ScientistAnswer38You <i>do</i> know you can use it as a light source, right? Stars above, please tell me you knew that.": 652,
"ScientistAnswer39Oh yeah, the observatory has an exhibit about that.": 653,

"Slate_ShipLog_IntroHey, hold up a sec!": 657,
"SlateSlate_ShipLog_IntroYeah yeah yeah, I already know about the launch codes.": 658,
"Slate_ShipLog_1What? No, I was going to tell you about using the ship log to set destination markers for locations you\u2019ve visited before.": 659,
"Slate_ShipLog_1It\u2019s a brilliant feature, if I say so myself. Dead useful. And the risk it poses of shorting out the fuel regulator and causing the ship to explode is so minimal that only Gossan would worry about it.": 660,
"SlateSlate_ShipLog_1Wait, so how do I use it?": 661,
"SlateSlate_ShipLog_1Use the ship log to mark a location I want to revisit. Got it.": 662,
"SlateSlate_ShipLog_1How minimal are we talking?": 663,
"SlateSlate_ShipLog_1What about locations I haven\u2019t visited before?": 664,
"Slate_ShipLog_1aWhen you\u2019re on your ship, open up its log to the location you want to mark. Anywhere\u2019s fine, as long as you\u2019ve been there at least once.": 665,
"Slate_ShipLog_1aHop in the pilot seat, and the ship will throw up a destination marker on your display. It\u2019s that easy.": 666,
"Slate_ShipLog_1bMinimal! Stars above, you worry too much. If anything\u2019s going to kill you, it\u2019s the autopilot.": 667,
"Slate_ShipLog_1cOh, sure, I\u2019ll just magically have the system know all the possible locations you plan to discover throughout the entire solar system, shall I?": 668,
"Slate_ShipLog_2\u201cWow, Slate! How do you come up with these incredible ideas?\u201d Oh, I do the best I can with what I\u2019ve got. Really, you\u2019re too kind.": 669,

"Slate_ShipLog_2cEveryone\u2019s a critic.": 675,
"Slate_ShipLog_3Anyway, I\u2019ve got a fire to enjoy, and you\u2019ve got launch codes to grab. Go wild with the marking feature while you're out there. Just, uh, try not to follow it so directly you fly into the sun, okay?": 676,

"Feldspar1...Say, it\u2019s you! They made you an astronaut? And you haven\u2019t blown yourself up yet, good for you!": 684,

"Feldspar2Yeah, that\u2019s right, I\u2019m alive. Been camping out here since my ship, uh, y\u2019know. Crashed.<Pause> Violently.": 690,

"FeldsparFeldspar2You <i>crashed</i>? But you\u2019re the greatest pilot in Hearthian history!": 692,

"FeldsparFeldspar4Tell me more about your flying prowess!": 699,
"FeldsparFeldspar4You crashed your ship, didn\u2019t you.": 700,
"Feldspar4aHaha, you flatter me!<Pause> ...I <i>like</i> it!": 701,
"Feldspar4b<i>Obviously</i>, yes. No need to be rude.": 702,
"Feldspar5...well, like I said, I crash. Blammo! On impact, my ship starts making noises like it\u2019s coming apart from the inside, and I think, well, that ain\u2019t great. Sure enough, I barely get out of there before the electrical systems start sparking like crazy.": 703,
"Feldspar5It\u2019s either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and my poor, fried ship.": 704,
"Feldspar5I camped out near where I crashed at first. I found this skeleton later \u2014 great find, would\u2019ve been stupid not to use it.": 705,
"Feldspar5So I moved my setup over here and planted my emergency tree seeds. Been here ever since!": 706,

"FeldsparFeldspar5I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t die.": 708,
"FeldsparFeldspar5I can\u2019t believe you destroyed your ship.": 709,
"FeldsparFeldspar5No wonder there are so many stories about you back home!": 710,
"Feldspar5aMy story goes like this. I\u2019d just finished exploring the core of Giant\u2019s Deep, and I wanted to try my hand at Dark Bramble, seeing as no one had ever been before.": 711,
"Feldspar5aGetting around in Dark Bramble was easy, mind you. Once you\u2019ve dodged one massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, you\u2019ve dodged \u2019em all.": 712,
"Feldspar5aBut after a while, I run into this huge anglerfish \u2014 you\u2019ve seen \u2019em? Big gnarly things, and this was the biggest one I\u2019ve ever seen. I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off \u2014 nothing too fancy. I\u2019m going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and...": 713,
"Feldspar5bOh, this is a good story. I\u2019d just finished exploring the core of Giant\u2019s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever been inside Dark Bramble, so I think, hey, let\u2019s give that a try.": 714,
"Feldspar5bI\u2019ve been cruising around for a while, dodging the odd massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, when I run into this huge anglerfish, the biggest I\u2019ve ever seen.": 715,
"Feldspar5bI pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off \u2014 nothing too fancy. I\u2019m going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and...": 716,

"Feldspar5cI came to Dark Bramble for the excitement. I\u2019d just finished exploring the core of Giant\u2019s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever gone farther than Dark Bramble\u2019s ice fields, so I thought, hey, let\u2019s give it a try.": 718,

"Feldspar6aYeah, pretty much.": 721,
"Feldspar6bYou know, in the old days, I used to think the same thing every time I came back from a flight in one piece.": 722,
"Feldspar6bThese days, I\u2019m used to it.": 723,
"Feldspar6cEasy for you to say. Your ship probably has all kinds of fancy modifications and upgrades, like \u201cworking retro boosters\u201d and \u201cnon-flammable construction materials.\u201d": 724,
"Feldspar6dHeh. You\u2019re not half-bad yourself, making it here in one piece.": 725,
"Feldspar7Anyway, that\u2019s how it all went down, hatchling!": 726,
"Feldspar7Story\u2019s over, but feel free to stay and enjoy the fire a while.": 727,
"Feldspar7Or don\u2019t. Fire\u2019s not going anywhere.": 728,
"FeldsparSkipHeh, you got it in one. Kind of hard not to, once you\u2019ve seen one of those fish up close and personal-like.": 729,

"FeldsparPrimaryMenuAnything else you wanted?": 731,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuI found something!": 732,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuWhere should I explore here?": 733,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuYou reached the core of Giant\u2019s Deep? How\u2019d you do it?": 734,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuWhere\u2019s your ship?": 735,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuWhat happened to this anglerfish?": 736,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuShouldn\u2019t I tell ground control to come get you?": 737,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuNah, I\u2019m good.": 738,

"FeldsparFeldsparSecondaryNah, I\u2019m good.": 747,
"FeldsparFishOh, the skeleton? It was like this when I got here.": 748,
"FeldsparFishAs near as I can tell, this anglerfish must have been chewing on the vine and eaten a seed, and then the seed grew and grew in the poor fish\u2019s stomach until... this happened.": 749,
"FeldsparFishGross, huh?": 750,
"FeldsparFishThis skeleton was a good find. Keeps the fish away. See, they\u2019re territorial, so they mostly avoid each other. That\u2019s why I set up camp here.": 751,
"FeldsparCoreGiant\u2019s Deep\u2019s core, huh? Ahhh, that was a wild one.": 752,
"FeldsparCoreBut since you\u2019re asking, I gotta assume you haven\u2019t made it down there yourself yet, right? If I tell you how, it kinda feels like cheating.": 753,
"FeldsparCoreHm...": 754,
"FeldsparCore...On a <i>completely unrelated</i> note, that sure was a big, hollow vine my ship crashed into.<Pause=3> Yep.": 755,
"FeldsparCoreIf I were you, I\u2019d go take a walk and see where it ends.": 756,
"FeldsparCoreYou\u2019ll want to go to the tail end of this anglerfish skeleton here and look for a flickering light in the fog \u2014 that\u2019ll be my old ship. Path starts there.": 757,
"FeldsparGoodIf you change your mind, you know where to find me!": 758,
"FeldsparRescueWell... yeah, sure, whenever you have the time.": 759,
"FeldsparRescueFrankly, I kinda like it out here. Quiet, peaceful...ish.": 760,
"FeldsparRescueYou\u2019re a little young to understand, but it\u2019s a lot of pressure, being the best that ever was. Been nice to have a break.": 761,
"FeldsparExploreThat\u2019s the spirit!": 762,
"FeldsparExploreAnywhere\u2019s good, but you should know that space is weird here. Intensely.": 763,
"FeldsparExploreEver tried throwing your scout into one of these weird seeds? See there, with the little opening? It\u2019s just big enough to launch one through.": 764,
"FeldsparExploreYour scout tracker will tell you the scout is in two places at once, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s... wrong, exactly, because space doesn\u2019t work right in here. That seed looks small, see? But inside, it\u2019s bigger.": 765,
"FeldsparExplore<i>Much</i> bigger.": 766,
"FeldsparExploreI\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about this, and my theory is space in Dark Bramble kind of expands as you go through each sphere. That\u2019s why it\u2019s bigger inside those seeds.": 767,
"FeldsparExploreWell, that\u2019s my theory. Keep that in mind while you\u2019re exploring Dark Bramble and maybe you won\u2019t get lost inside forever.": 768,
"FeldsparExploreGood luck!": 769,
"FeldsparShipwreckNot far from here, as a matter of fact! If you go straight past the tail of this anglerfish skeleton here, you\u2019ll see a flickering light in the fog.": 770,
"FeldsparShipwreckFollow that, and you\u2019ll find my old ship.<Pause> What\u2019s left of it, anyway.": 771,
"FoundSomethingMenuLay it on me, hatchling!": 772,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuI went to the core of Giant\u2019s Deep.": 773,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuI found the frozen jellyfish near your ship.": 774,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuI found the Anglerfish nest.": 775,

"FoundSomething1So you figured out the ol\u2019 tornado trick, did you? Good work!": 780,
"FoundSomething1I found that bit out by accident, but let\u2019s keep that between you and me, hey? Hornfels would have my very handsome head if they knew I\u2019d been riding the cyclones again.": 781,

"FoundSomething1And the jellyfish, you figured those out, too? Hatchling, I tell you what, you\u2019ve done real well for yourself! You\u2019re a fine astronaut, sure, but you might just become a pilot yet!": 783,
"FoundSomething2Ha! So the old thing still there, is it? That\u2019s where I first camped out after the crash, you know. It was pretty cozy inside!": 784,
"FoundSomething2It does lack the structural integrity and indomitable spirit of a camp made in the shelter of the very bones of the species that tried to eat you, I suppose.": 785,
"FoundSomething2Still. Very cozy.": 786,
"FoundSomething3So that\u2019s where the blasted things come from, is it? Stars above, if I still had a working ship, I\u2019d be sorely tempted to go show \u2019em what\u2019s what!": 787,
"FoundSomething3<color=grey>Sigh...</color>": 788,
"FoundSomething3Probably best to leave \u2019em alone, though, really. More trouble than it\u2019s worth to mess with anglerfish.": 789,

"CASSAVA: Conoy, Daz and I were lifting <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> components into orbit for assembly, and one somehow sank down down <i>beneath</i> the current.": 844,
"DAZ: Cassava convinced me not to try to recreate the phenomenon myself using other cannon parts, but we\u2019re very curious to know what happened! How could something pass through the current?": 845,
"CONOY: My gratitude for your interesting question! This is exciting: Spire constructed a model of <color=lightblue>Giant\u2019s Deep</color> here at <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>\u2019s <color=orange>Southern Observatory</color>, and it's revealed how an object might sink below the current.": 846,
"CASSAVA: Conoy, I\u2019m unable to grasp the answer by looking through the <color=orange>projection pool</color>. If I visit the <color=orange>observatory</color>, would you kindly explain?": 847,
"CONOY: If you don\u2019t mind the trek beneath the surface to the south pole, I\u2019d be delighted to see you! (There are two trailheads, one at <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>'s <color=orange>gravity cannon</color> and one at the <color=orange>Tower of Quantum Knowledge</color>.)": 848,
"DAZ: Conoy, you should\u2019ve seen it! We\u2019d thought it was impossible for any cannon components to sink even partially below the current, but ours sank straight to the core!": 849,

"COLEUS: However, something strange is happening when I ask the <color=orange>Eye signal locator</color> to follow the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s signal: The device\u2019s indicator rotates wildly and never points to just one direction.": 851,
"THATCH: This is a curious result. It\u2019s possible the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> has stopped calling out its signal.": 852,

"Friend3You haven\u2019t heard? Gabbro brought it back with them from Giant\u2019s Deep, and Hornfels just finished prepping it for display. This is it right here. Neat, huh?": 870,
"Friend4Yeah, I get that you\u2019re dying to head out into space, but seriously, you\u2019ve got to see this statue before you go. It\u2019s an amazing find!": 871,

"Friend6Good question! So Gabbro found this fully intact statue on Giant\u2019s Deep, right? Well, Hornfels told me it\u2019s made from the same type of special stone as the partial statue Chert brought back from the Hourglass Twins.": 895,
"Friend6That\u2019s why when Gabbro, you know, chipped the Giant\u2019s Deep statue, that stone fragment was repurposed for your ship\u2019s computer.": 896,
"Friend6Maybe the statues were made for storing information?": 897,
"Friend7From Giant\u2019s Deep! Gabbro fished it out of the oceans and brought it back here for study.": 898,
"Friend7Hornfels doesn\u2019t know much about it yet, just that it\u2019s <i>crazy</i> old and super tough. I wonder why the Nomai carved it?": 899,
"Friend7Apparently, Gabbro went back to Giant\u2019s Deep to try to learn more about the statue. Maybe they\u2019ll find some answers there.": 900,
"Friend8Hey, you never know \u2014 maybe you\u2019ll be the one to solve the mysteries of the Nomai!": 901,

"ANNONA: You have keen eyes, my friend. So this moon travels to a total of five locations, not four.": 911,
"BUR: I added a marker for <color=lightblue>Dark Bramble</color>.": 912,
"BUR: I thought the <color=orange>locator</color> now accounted for all of the <color=lightblue>phantom moon</color>\u2019s locations, but sometimes the <color=orange>locator</color> can\u2019t tell where the moon is. Perhaps there\u2019s a problem with the device?": 913,
"MELORAE: It\u2019s also possible there exists a sixth place in this star system to which the <color=lightblue>phantom moon</color> travels.": 914,
"Melorae: If you\u2019ve come here to look for Coleus, this is where we were when he vanished. He\u2019s been missing for two days now!": 915,
"Annona: Your strange, wandering rock friend is here, though Coleus isn\u2019t.": 916,
"Melorae: Coleus and I observed this unusual-looking rock shard (and several smaller rocks) in at least two other caverns. I\u2019m unsure if this is relevant.": 917,
"BUR: What happened before Coleus disappeared?": 918,
"Melorae: We were examining the different rocks. I recall Coleus standing on the largest one (the wandering rock). I was taking notes, and then my lantern died.": 919,
"Melorae: When I lit it again, Coleus and the rock were both gone.": 920,
"Should we build the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> to power the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>?": 921,
"IDAEA: I almost can\u2019t comprehend this is being suggested seriously. The purpose of the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> goes against every standard we hold ourselves to and everything we believe in as a species!": 922,
"PYE: Unsurprisingly, Idaea, I disagree. We\u2019re pushing a possible new technology further than ever before. That, in my experience, is the defining characteristic of our species.": 923,
"YARROW: Are there other ways to generate this level of power?": 924,
"PYE: Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. I can\u2019t imagine discovering them in our lifetimes...": 925,
"RAMIE: I understand this proposal is unsettling, but the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> must be built if we hope to complete the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>.": 926,
"COLEUS: If we fail (and the probability of this is not insignificant), we will without question destroy ourselves, all life here, and the rest of this star system. I wish to protect these species.": 927,
"IDAEA: The potential annihilation of an entire star system is too severe a cost. We shouldn\u2019t build the <color=orange>Sun Station</color>, no matter how badly we want the knowledge that comes with it.": 928,
"POKE: Fear of failure is a poor reason not to try. I believe, if we\u2019re cautious, the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will work. I believe in Pye.": 929,
"PYE: Poke, I\u2019m deeply honored. Idaea, I comprehend your position; however, if we aren\u2019t all but certain the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will not cause destruction once we\u2019ve built it, then I won\u2019t support the station\u2019s use.": 930,
"RAMIE: Note: This door will need to remain closed for some <i>time</i>! Pye and I are running an experiment based on the extraordinary findings from the <color=orange>White Hole Station</color>.": 931,
"PYE: Ramie and I will be running this experiment until one of us (specifically, me) can prove the other wrong, so although it\u2019s inconvenient, the lab currently can only be accessed by the path from the <color=orange>Sunless City</color>.": 932,
"RAMIE: Inviting sand inside would disrupt our setup and could have enormous consequences. (We realize this is an intriguing prospect, but the door must remain closed nonetheless!)": 933,
"RAMIE: An update: The <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color> is now being used to design the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>! If you\u2019re here to help (or even just to observe), be sure to use the <color=orange>Sunless City</color> path to the lab.": 934,
"RAMIE: The <color=orange>Southern Observatory</color> is asking if creating a 22 minute interval is possible (that is, to have something arrive 22 minutes before it is actually sent through the warp).": 935,
"RAMIE: We\u2019ve learned the negative interval of time between departure and arrival can be increased by adding more energy to the warp core. Problematically, the energy required to extend the interval increases at an exponential rate.": 936,
"PYE: Hypothesis: Creating a 22-minute-long interval is possible, but we are currently unable to generate the necessary energy.": 937,
"PYE: Ramie and I believe it would be necessary to invent a new method of producing energy, a thrilling but enormous undertaking. We would also require advanced warp technology able to handle such energy.": 938,
"PYE: We would also likely need an enormous space to fit these proposed new energy and warp technologies together. The only location large enough would be <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>.": 939,
"RAMIE: The energy is <i>currently</i> unavailable, you say? You\u2019re a gas, Pye!": 940,
"PYE: My pun was unintended, Ramie, so I believe it\u2019s you who\u2019s aeriform!": 941,
"PYE: Records show Nomai arriving at the warp receiver on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color> very slightly before departing from the <color=orange>White Hole Station</color>. Ramie and I are devising an experiment to test if this is a real phenomenon or simple machine error.": 942,
"RAMIE: In theory, what we want to try to reproduce is a negative amount of time elapsing between something entering the black hole and exiting the white hole at its destination.": 943,
"PYE: Initial things first: Our experiment setup will first pair a small black hole core with a small white hole core to mimic the setup on the <color=orange>White Hole Station</color>.": 944,
"RAMIE: Hypothesis: It is possible for an object to exit a white hole before entering the corresponding black hole.": 945,
"RAMIE: An update: Our experiment here reproduced the anomaly in arrival and departure times, but Pye is unconvinced it\u2019s more than an equipment error. I hope to strengthen the effect to render it visible to the unaided eyes.": 946,
"PYE: To that end, we\u2019ve decided to try adding more energy. I imagine the <color=orange>Sunless City</color>\u2019s energy supply should prove sufficient.": 947,
"PYE: Of note, Ramie: Yarrow requests that we let him know before we reroute energy to the experiment.": 948,
"RAMIE: I\u2019d hate to leave him in the dark!": 949,
"PYE: All available energy has been rerouted from the city to our experiment. Ramie and I are about to run a new test.": 950,
"RAMIE: Hypothesis confirmed! Hypothesis confirmed! I saw it! Pye saw it! <i>Hypothesis confirmed</i>!": 951,

"SECCA: Our <color=orange>escape pod</color> crashed as we tried to flee this place, destroying our movement and communication capabilities in the process.": 953,
"SECCA: We\u2019ve held out as long as we could here, but this pod\u2019s supply of breathable air is nearly depleted, and the anglerfish attack more and more frequently.": 954,
"SECCA: Our best chance at survival is to return to the <color=orange>Vessel</color> to either repair the damage or, more probably, await rescue.": 955,
"ESCALL: Secca, is the message finished? The <color=orange>Vessel</color>\u2019s beacon is already growing fainter; it will be gone in a matter of hours. We need to leave here, quickly.": 956,
"CANNA: To any Nomai clans whose Vessels can hear this message:": 957,
"CANNA: It\u2019s clear the universe is dying. There are fewer and fewer resources and safe places within space now, so my clan and I believe the best option is for all of our clans to stay together.": 958,
"CANNA: If you can reach the Gloaming Galaxy, we\u2019ve found that Blackrock\u2019s suns are fairly stable, and life in this star system is (comparatively) thriving. We live in relative safety.": 959,
"CANNA: If you prefer to continue exploring alone, know you will be on your own.": 960,
"BROMI: Canna, we\u2019re making our way to you.": 961,
"CANNA: It\u2019s good to hear from you, Bromi! We\u2019ll watch for your Vessel.": 962,
"CANNA: Has anyone heard from Neem? His clan was on its way to our Vessel, but they never arrived, and he hasn\u2019t sent any messages. I\u2019m beginning to worry.": 963,
"BROMI: That <i>is</i> unsettling. It reminds me of that old myth my grandfather used to tell, the Disappearance of Escall.": 964,
"CLEM: I remember hearing that story as a child! One day, Escall\u2019s <color=orange>Vessel</color> simply stopped responding. The other clans searched and searched, but found no trace. It was as if their missing friends had warped out of existence.": 965,
"HYSSOP: That\u2019s no myth, friends; Escall\u2019s clan existed, and their story was real.": 966,
"BROMI: What a curious event to have passed into myth! Our ancestors\u2019 ancestors were told that story when they were young. Are you sure it\u2019s true, Hyssop?": 967,
"HYSSOP: It was a very long time ago, but yes. My clan\u2019s ancestors searched for Escall\u2019s clan for a long time, but in the end, none of them were ever seen again. (It\u2019s the only time in our history a Vessel has ever disappeared this way.)": 968,
"NEEM: Hyssop, I hope you aren\u2019t comparing Escall\u2019s story to my clan\u2019s Vessel!": 969,
"CLEM: Neem, my friend! We feared you were gone!": 970,
"NEEM: Not yet, we aren\u2019t, but nearly. We found trouble during our warp: The triple suns of the Bright Spark star system exploded, and it was only a lucky coincidence we weren\u2019t caught in the blast. We\u2019ll meet you soon, Canna!": 971,
"CANNA: I\u2019m relieved your clan is safe, Neem! It\u2019s good to hear your words. Any Vessels nearby, remember to be extremely cautious of potentially unstable stars (which is most of them, now).": 972,
"FILIX: This is Escall\u2019s <color=orange>Vessel</color>; something went badly wrong during our warp, and our <color=orange>Vessel</color> is mortally wounded. We need help as quickly as possible!": 973,
"FILIX: Our <color=orange>Vessel</color> appears to have... has it <i>fused</i> with the local environment, somehow? There are vines that are now part of the <color=orange>Vessel</color>! It\u2019s been torn apart from inside itself!": 974,
"FILIX: We... we are abandoning our <color=orange>Vessel</color>. Any Nomai clans or spaceflight-capable species receiving this message, I implore you, we need your help!": 975,
"FILIX: Is this broken? Can anyone hear me? Our <color=orange>Vessel</color> is dying! We need immediate assistance!": 976,
"FILIX: I\u2019m recording now \u2014 I\u2019ve never encountered anything like this! The signal the <color=orange>Vessel</color> is receiving appears to be <i>older than the universe itself</i>!": 977,
"ESCALL: This is our first contact with anything of this nature. Everyone, prepare to warp immediately!": 978,
"FILIX: Escall, wait, I need more time to send an outgoing message! Shouldn\u2019t we tell another clan where we\u2019re going?": 979,
"ESCALL: We can send the message upon our arrival. This extraordinary signal appeared suddenly; it may disappear just as quickly, and we can\u2019t lose a discovery this incredible! Focus on preparing for the warp, instead.": 980,
"FILIX: I understand!": 981,
"ESCALL: Annona, is the <color=orange>Vessel</color> ready to warp to the signal\u2019s approximate coordinates?": 982,
"ANNONA: The warp core is powered, but this will be a significant jump. Afterward, we\u2019ll need time to recharge the core.": 983,
"ESCALL: That shouldn\u2019t create a problem, provided we arrive at or near the signal\u2019s source. Everyone, we\u2019re ready to warp!": 984,
"CASSAVA: This is it: We\u2019ve finished building the final <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> module and are ready to send it into orbit around <color=lightblue>Giant\u2019s Deep</color> for assembly!": 985,
"CASSAVA: To all my friends here at the <color=orange>Construction Yard</color>, my gratitude for your tireless work. I had given up hope, but I truly believe this cannon may actually succeed where many other attempts have not.": 986,
"DAZ: Are you going gelatinous on us, love? I\u2019m delighted by your words, but they\u2019re atypical for you!": 987,
"CASSAVA: If I\u2019m ever half as gooey as Mallow and Avens behave together, Daz, you may launch <i>me</i> from the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color>.": 988,
"CASSAVA: Our next step will be to send Privet up to the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> to install the probe tracking system.": 989,
"DAZ: If I know my brother, Avens (and his spouse) will want to launch the probe with as much power as possible. I\u2019m worried the cannon would break under the strain.": 990,

"PYE: You lack a sense of humor.": 1013,
"IDAEA: At least I don\u2019t lack a sense of ethics!": 1014,
"PYE: Kindly refrain from going supernova on me before the <color=lightblue>sun</color> does, Idaea.": 1015,
"THATCH: Where should this new, more sophisticated locator be built? It may need to be larger than this <color=orange>Eye signal locator</color> is.": 1016,
"PLUME: The southern glacier on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color> has ample available space. I could construct a new building to house this proposed locator.": 1017,
"FILIX: Yes, let\u2019s build there! I imagine our young friend Conoy would enjoy that immensely. He\u2019s always held a great interest in the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>, especially for a child born so long after the crash.": 1018,
"PLUME: I will begin construction on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>\u2019s south pole immediately, then!": 1019,
"COLEUS: Annona and those of us originally stranded on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color> built a <color=orange>Quantum Moon locator</color> there, but the heat of the <color=lightblue>sun</color> made its construction challenging. I wouldn\u2019t recommend building on that planet.": 1020,
"COLEUS: After closer observation, mining site 2a wouldn\u2019t be safe for the native life dwelling in some of this cave\u2019s pools, so (unfortunately) we\u2019ll have to mine one of the other sites.": 1021,
"COLEUS: On the opposite hand, new life! This species is semi-aquatic, and very hardy. The ecosystem here is quite robust, so I believe they\u2019ll thrive in the long run. Be cautious near the pools if you visit 2a to meet them.": 1022,
"CYCAD: There are a few other cave sites that look promising. What about site 2b (it shares similar formations and strata)?": 1023,
"OENO: This sounds promising! Will you and your mentor investigate? If mining site 2b proves safe for this native species, we\u2019ll move our work there.": 1024,
"CYCAD: Site 2b is safe! Coleus says we\u2019ll continue to monitor our activity and its effect on life here.": 1025,
"CYCAD: I was watching them once during a rest, and the hours escaped from me. They\u2019re fascinating (I wonder what their fourth eye does)!": 1026,
"COLEUS: They remind me of a subterranean species that my mentor, Melorae, once told me about (from when our clan used to travel across this universe). I imagine she would have enjoyed these lifeforms greatly.": 1027,
"CASSAVA: We\u2019re nearly ready! Filix and I have finished construction, and she says calibrating the device won\u2019t take long.": 1028,
"FILIX: Fortunately, the <color=lightblue>Attlerock</color>\u2019s lack of atmosphere will make calibration simple. After all this time, I\u2019m thrilled to finally resume our search!": 1029,
"Caution: You are about to access the core while the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> is active.": 1030,
"WARNING: Removing the core will disable the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>.": 1031,
"Artificial gravity control": 1032,
"YARROW: Today we finished the excavation of <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>. Here, in this space we carved, we will craft our most ambitious project yet: the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>, powerful enough to send information back in time.": 1033,
"COLEUS: We\u2019ve also finished relocating all subterranean plants we met while digging.": 1034,
"RAMIE: We\u2019ll need to keep our eyes on how significantly we\u2019ve altered the environment here.": 1035,
"PYE: How far we\u2019ve come since our experiments at the <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color>! I still can hardly believe Ramie\u2019s hypothesis was true.": 1036,
"YARROW: Poke just sent the warp core for the final tower to us from the <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color>. Now <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color> can be connected with <color=lightblue>Giant\u2019s Deep</color>, where Cassava is working with Avens to craft the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color>, and where Phlox is sculpting the memory statues.": 1037,
"CASSAVA: Hypothesis: It was not by accident the core of our warp tower was the last to be forged.": 1038,
"POKE: Hypothesis: The cores could have been forged faster if Cassava had interrupted my work less frequently to ask for updates.": 1039,
"YARROW: The important point is we are all connected through <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color> now, and also that I\u2019m no longer needed for mediating your disagreements.": 1040,
"YARROW: Our friends on <color=lightblue>Giant\u2019s Deep</color> tested the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> today. Mallow tells me the cannon is doing well, and that Avens advocates for more launch power. If anyone can coax the maximum power from a device, Avens can.": 1041,
"YARROW: But then, if anyone can goad a device into exploding, that, too, is likely Avens. Perhaps I should check in with the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> crew in the interest of safety.": 1042,
"YARROW: Would it help to remind Avens that Mallow (his love) will be one of the Nomai aboard the cannon, or is Mallow part of the problem?": 1043,
"YARROW: Pye and Idaea have worked hard on the <color=orange>Sun Station</color>, and it at last is complete. If everything goes as planned, this structure will prompt the <color=lightblue>sun</color>\u2019s explosion, which will in turn supply the power the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> requires.": 1044,
"RAMIE: I\u2019m impressed by their mental fortitude. This was the project\u2019s most difficult task, in more ways than one.": 1045,
"YARROW: We\u2019re nearly ready to activate the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>! Here is what will happen: First, the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will receive the order to fire at the <color=lightblue>sun</color>, prompting it to explode.": 1046,
"YARROW: Using the energy from the resulting supernova, the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> will send the order for the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> to fire back in time by 22 minutes.": 1047,
"YARROW: Exactly 22 minutes after these orders are received, the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will again trigger the supernova to send the probe data from this cannon launch back in time.": 1048,
"YARROW: In total, each cycle created by the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> will last precisely 22 minutes. We can end this cycle at will.": 1049,
"YARROW: These words are difficult to write: The <color=orange>Sun Station</color> did not work.": 1050,
"YARROW: However, this is the closest we have ever been. The <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> is theoretically sound; we were only unable to power it. Perhaps there is another way.": 1051,
"PYE: Suppose we redesign the <color=orange>Sun Station</color>. To generate power of that magnitude, a supernova is still our only viable option.": 1052,
"IDAEA: This is easier expressed than accomplished.": 1053,
"PYE: You can wait for the <color=lightblue>sun</color> to explode on its natural timeline if you prefer, Idaea, but you\u2019ll need to find some way to halt our aging process.": 1054,
"RAMIE: I believe we can still find a way to create a supernova, my friend. Don\u2019t lose hope!": 1055,
"YARROW: We are halting our research into creating a supernova for this moment; a <color=lightblue>comet</color> has newly arrived in this solar system, and we\u2019re anxious to explore it.": 1056,
"YARROW: It\u2019s been a very long time since we last explored somewhere new, so we\u2019re excited to welcome this <color=lightblue>comet</color>. Imagine what knowledge might be gained there!": 1057,
"PYE: Friends visiting from the <color=orange>Hanging City</color>, we are planning the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> at the <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color> on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>\u2019s equator.": 1058,
"CONOY: I became lost on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color> (my gratitude that Ramie found me!), but the <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color> is the building with the large solar panels. I\u2019m suprised I didn\u2019t see it!": 1059,
"RAMIE: I imagine our otherwise immensely clever Conoy would lose his own head if it weren\u2019t anatomically impossible!": 1060,
"The <color=orange>shuttle</color> is currently resting at the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>.": 1061,
"What is the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>?": 1062,
"The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is the source of the signal that brought us here.": 1063,
"Suppose the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is a more advanced being.": 1064,
"The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is older than this universe, so imagine how much it could teach us.": 1065,
"Perhaps it is a cosmic library!": 1066,
"What is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s signal?": 1067,
"Suppose the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> wishes to communicate.": 1068,
"The signal is a call. Were we the intended audience?": 1069,
"The signal is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s voice. It speaks a language we don\u2019t yet know.": 1070,
"Or maybe the signal is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s attempt at expressing itself.": 1071,
"Of note: From the signal, we were able to determine the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s approximate age (or perhaps its lack of age?).": 1072,
"Be welcomed in this place. This shrine is a space to reflect on what brought us to this star system: the signal from the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>.": 1073,
"We observed the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s signal in our travels, and followed it here to find its source.": 1074,
"What we know is this: The source of the signal (which we have chosen to call the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>) is older than this universe itself. The rest, we have yet to learn.": 1075,
"Enter, and open your mind to its possibilities.": 1076,
"Solution 1: We could retrieve the warp core from the <color=orange>Vessel</color>.": 1077,
"RAMIE: The <color=orange>Vessel</color>\u2019s warp core is broken, at best (recall those present when the <color=orange>Vessel</color> crashed said it sustained lethal injuries). There is no guaranteed reward for this risk.": 1078,
"CONOY: Perhaps we could still repair it. My grandmother told me there was little time to assess the nature or extent of the damage.": 1079,
"CASSAVA: Even if it no longer functions, the old core could be a valuable blueprint, provided we\u2019re able to transport it back here.": 1080,
"PHLOX: This would require a return to <color=lightblue>Dark Bramble</color>. Plume (my father) said many good Nomai perished there.": 1081,
"CYCAD: My mentor (Coleus) and his old mentor once discovered and studied an anglerfish fossil on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>. Using that knowledge, we could avoid the anglerfish entirely!": 1082,
"COLEUS: What Melorae and I learned from that fossil would theoretically help us evade the anglerfish, but our hypothesis was never tested on a live specimen.": 1083,
"RAMIE: I remember that anglerfish fossil! We used to play in <color=orange>Fossil Fish Cave</color> when we were children.": 1084,
"SOLANUM: I no longer believe, as I did as a child on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>, that the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color> (the source of the signal) wishes to harm us. But it may not want to be found, either.": 1085,
"SOLANUM: The terrible circumstances of our arrival here were almost certainly exactly that: circumstance.": 1086,
"SOLANUM: I suspect imagining we are special to the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> in some way is wishful thinking. The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> might have called out to any sentient species.": 1087,
"SOLANUM: Or it might not have been calling out at all, and that my ancestors heard the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s signal holds no great, deep meaning.": 1088,
"SOLANUM: This wouldn\u2019t be so bad, I think.": 1089,
"SOLANUM: In fact, the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> may not have wishes at all. We have no evidence supporting this.": 1090,
"ILEX: Why We Should Build A New Vessel": 1091,
"ILEX: Each Nomai clan explores the universe in its own Vessel. The Vessel is the heart of every clan.": 1092,
"ILEX: It\u2019s unusual for Nomai to remain in one place for so long. Nomai are wanderers and have no permanent home.": 1093,
"ILEX: If we built a new Vessel, we could return to our adventurous way of life. Imagine all the new places we could go! Our clan wouldn\u2019t be stuck here in this star system.": 1094,
"ILEX: We could even meet with other Nomai, and learn from them, like Coleus says we used to do.": 1095,
"ILEX: It probably wouldn\u2019t be hard to get parts if we stopped building other new things, and if we broke down other structures (like the towers on <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>) for parts.": 1096,
"ILEX: We might have to build a smaller Vessel for now, even though Vessels are normally large. But we could make it bigger later once we reach planets with more resources.": 1097,
"ILEX: It would also help if we stopped building so many things to search for the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>. I asked Yarrow, and he says we use lots of resources on the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>.": 1098,
"ILEX: We could even have a warp core for jumping long distances like Vessels have. Poke tells me she plans to make a very advanced warp core for a different project. I\u2019m sure she could connect it to the Vessel for travel (because Poke is smart).": 1099,
"THATCH: Is everyone unharmed?": 1100,
"PLUME: No one was badly injured from the <color=orange>escape pod\u2019s</color> impact. We\u2019re incredibly fortunate.": 1101,
"THATCH: This is good news, at least. Have we heard from <color=orange>Escape Pod 2</color> or <color=orange>Escape Pod 3</color>?": 1102,
"FILIX: No, I... I\u2019m unable to make contact. My equipment can hear the other two escape pods\u2019 distress signals, however. If it\u2019s any comfort, both pods must be structurally intact.": 1103,
"FILIX: I\u2019ll continue calling for them.": 1104,
"THATCH: My gratitude. If we can \u2014": 1105,
"PLUME: Thatch, the moon is approaching again!": 1106,
"THATCH: Everyone brace yourselves, swiftly! The <color=lightblue>volcanic moon</color> has returned!": 1107,
"THATCH: Be cautious of falling ash and debris!": 1108,
"PLUME: ...I believe the moon has passed.": 1109,
"FILIX: This planet doesn\u2019t appear eager to have guests. We are certainly unwelcome on its surface.": 1110,
"THATCH: We need to find shelter, and quickly. The <color=lightblue>volcanic moon</color> won\u2019t be gone for long.": 1111,
"PLUME: I observed several promising sites below the surface, but we\u2019ll need to construct a way for everyone to climb safely down this cliff. Perhaps we could build platforms?": 1112,
"CONOY: What have we learned thus far in our search for the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>?": 1113,
"PLUME: Those of us on the <color=orange>Vessel</color> originally followed the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s signal to this star system, but we were unable to warp to the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> itself.": 1114,
"PRIVET: The locator we built on the <color=lightblue>Attlerock</color> and the new, more sensitive locator we built here were both unable to detect any trace of the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s signal.": 1115,
"AVENS: Hypothesis: The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> has stopped emitting its signal.": 1116,
"CASSAVA: Suppose the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> doesn\u2019t wish to be found.": 1117,
"PLUME: Cassava, how can you suggest that? The <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s signal called out to summon us to this star system!": 1118,
"CASSAVA: I\u2019m aware; I grew up hearing the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s story. Yet we\u2019re no closer to finding it than you were when you first arrived here.": 1119,
"MALLOW: Based on our knowledge of the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>, we believe the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is in orbit around this star system\u2019s <color=lightblue>sun</color>. This would mean the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is located within a finite (albeit enormous) range.": 1120,
"CONOY: How should our methods change as we continue our search for the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>?": 1121,
"PRIVET: As we couldn\u2019t find the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s signal using two different devices built for this exact purpose, we should discontinue this search method.": 1122,
"MALLOW: We know what the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> looks like thanks to the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>, so what if we try to find the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> visually, instead? Let\u2019s send out a probe!": 1123,
"CASSAVA: Mallow\u2019s idea is clever, but we have no idea where the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is in relation to here. The probability of launching a probe in the correct direction would be absurdly small.": 1124,
"CONOY: I believe I have a solution for that problem! Have you spoken with Ramie and Pye about the technology they\u2019re developing?": 1125,
"AVENS: We\u2019d need to build a probe-launching mechanism to cover those long distances quickly. A cannon in orbit around a celestial body would circumvent the need to escape gravity\u2019s pull.": 1126,
"CASSAVA: <color=lightblue>Giant\u2019s Deep</color> would be a good choice. It\u2019s furthest from the <color=lightblue>sun</color>, so it would provide the best angles for launch. And it\u2019s moonless (except when the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color> is visiting).": 1127,
"AVENS: Yes, let\u2019s build the cannon in orbit around <color=lightblue>Giant\u2019s Deep</color>!": 1128,
"PLUME: The pain of your absence is sharp and haunting, and I would give anything not to know it; anything but never knowing you at all (which would be worse).": 1129,
"PLUME: I can only hope that you are safe, Keek, wherever you are.": 1130,
"KOUSA: We can hear the other escape pods\u2019 distress signals, which gives me hope. Foli, are you still here? I am unsure how to survive in this place without you.": 1131,
"KOUSA: (I am unsure how to be me without you.)": 1132,
"PLUME: My brother wasn\u2019t in <color=orange>Escape Pod 1</color> with us. Was he in <color=orange>Pod 2</color>, or <color=orange>Pod 3</color>? Was he able to board an escape pod at all?": 1133,
"PLUME: We sacrificed too much arriving here. I cannot (<i>I will</i> not) allow our clan\u2019s greatest loss to be in vain.": 1134,
"THATCH: Is the hardest part of this tragedy not knowing who we may have lost? Or will the hardest part come later, when we learn? (Be well, Aunt Melorae...)": 1135,
"PLUME: Given concerns about our settlement\u2019s stability, where should we construct a new, less temporary shelter?": 1136,
"THATCH: We need to stay close to the <color=orange>escape pod</color> so Filix can monitor incoming messages. We can\u2019t be rescued if we aren\u2019t present to respond.": 1137,
"FILIX: I don\u2019t believe anyone is coming to save us, Thatch. Now we must save ourselves.": 1138,
"PLUME: I agree. We\u2019re here because the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s signal called to us and we followed. If we\u2019re to find it, we need to not merely survive, but thrive.": 1139,
"PLUME: I believe we should migrate to the northern glacier.": 1140,
"FILIX: What if we use gravity crystals to craft a stable path?": 1141,
"THATCH: Building beneath the crust again would shelter us from the <color=lightblue>volcanic moon</color>\u2019s eruptions.": 1142,
"THATCH: This is a wise point, Plume, and eloquently made. If moving to the northern glacier will keep us safer, then that is what we should do.": 1143,
"FILIX: Has anyone observed the <color=lightblue>phantom moon</color> that sometimes greets us in the night sky? Your thoughts interest me.": 1144,
"THATCH: I compliment your eyes! How do you imagine it disappears? Hypothesis: Could it be a shift in the light spectrum?": 1145,
"PLUME: Suppose this moon is too shy to show us its face.": 1146,
"PLUME: I\u2019m interested in your playful moon. Is it much like its violent friend (<color=lightblue>Hollow\u2019s Lantern</color>)?": 1147,
"THATCH: Imagine if there were <i>two</i> volcanic moons.": 1148,
"PLUME: Then I imagine there\u2019d be none of us left!": 1149,
"FILIX: Hypothesis: There can exist too much lava.": 1150,
"THATCH: I\u2019d strongly prefer we test the null hypothesis.": 1151,
"FILIX: This moon isn\u2019t volcanic (to my unaided eyes). Sometimes it leaves its friend <color=lightblue>Hollow\u2019s Lantern</color> for nights at a time.": 1152,
"PLUME: The nights the moon circles this planet appear random. It seems to travel as it likes.": 1153,
"If the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> called to us, why won\u2019t it reveal itself? Why is it so difficult to locate it?": 1154,
"Did something happen to it?": 1155,
"Did the signal stop? Does the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> no longer desire to be found?": 1156,
"Perhaps this isn\u2019t the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>\u2019s choice. The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> may not be able to communicate with us more than it already has.": 1157,
"Did the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> deliberately call out to us by sending the signal, or did we hear the signal by coincidence?": 1158,
"We could be seeing meaning where there is none. Suppose the signal was produced incidentally.": 1159,
"Does that mean the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is any less important, though?": 1160,
"Perhaps the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> wanted to be found (could it be sentient?). Maybe it chose us.": 1161,
"Does the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> desire something from us? Could it need us in some way?": 1162,
"Maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be us.": 1163,

"COLEUS: This is the start of the path to the shelter site. I\u2019ve left directions to guide you there.": 1194,

"MELORAE: I\u2019m entirely delighted! It\u2019s never too early to appreciate biology!": 1198,
"COLEUS: This anglerfish\u2019s digestive tract suggests death by starvation.": 1199,
"MELORAE: Visually, the specimen appears to be of the same species as the anglerfish in <color=lightblue>Dark Bramble</color>. We don\u2019t believe it originated from this planet.": 1200,
"MELORAE: The long growth protruding from its head is bioluminescent. Perhaps it used this growth to attract prey (a lure?).": 1201,

"MELORAE: This planet sometimes (and only sometimes) has a <color=lightblue>moon</color>! This is also of note: It disappears if no one is watching it! Isn\u2019t that a <i>fascinating</i> orbital characteristic?": 1210,
"BUR: I found your note, Melorae; kindly count me among this <color=lightblue>moon</color>\u2019s admirers! What is happening when it disappears (I doubt it ceases to exist)? Does it move to another location?": 1211,
"ANNONA: I believe so. Not only does the moon appear around <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>, I can confirm it sometimes orbits <color=lightblue>Timber Hearth</color>, as well.": 1212,
"MELORAE: This is my first time encountering a natural satellite with the ability to vanish when not being watched. We should study it! Or, even better, we should travel there!": 1213,
"BUR: I agree! Our first step would be determining a method to track this <color=lightblue>phantom moon</color> so that we can always know where it is.": 1214,
"ANNONA: Given its reluctance to move while consciously observed, it might be a form of macroscopic quantum mechanics.": 1215,
"COLEUS: How curious! This rock took me with it to a new location. I wonder why this happened?": 1216,
"COLEUS: Curious, but also alarming: This new cave appears to lack an entrance or exit. Also, the rock that brought me here disappeared while I wasn\u2019t watching.": 1217,
"COLEUS: The wandering rock has returned! Never before have I been so delighted to see a sedimentary specimen.": 1218,
"COLEUS: I wonder if I myself became quantum briefly when the rock carried me here! This seems the clearest explanation. Hypothesis: If the rock can bring me here, it can also carry me out.": 1219,
"COLEUS: My hypothesis was correct! I can travel on this rock, as long as I\u2019m not observing my surroundings (meaning I must be in complete darkness). I\u2019m going to bring my mentor here to see this.": 1220,
"COLEUS: Melorae is here now, too. We theorize when a conscious being is in contact with a quantum object and ceases to observe his or her surroundings, the being can become entangled with that quantum object, and they move together.": 1221,

He vanished from the <color=orange>Lakebed Cave</color> (the one at the bottom of the dry lakebed at the north pole) several days ago, and we\u2019re unable to find any trace of him. I don\u2019t know how much air he had when he disappeared. I beg any friend reading this, help us recover Coleus!": 1223,
"MELORAE: Friends, if you find any sign of Coleus, I implore you to tell me! He vanished without a trace during our research trip, and has been missing ever since.": 1224,
"BUR: Melorae, some of us from the <color=orange>Sunless City</color> are here to help search for Coleus. Can you tell us more about your expedition?": 1225,
"MELORAE: You have my gratitude, Bur! Coleus and I were studying the caves\u2019 geology. We hoped to learn more about a unique and wandering rock that visits several different caves in the area.": 1226,
"ANNONA: Where was young Coleus lost, Melorae?": 1227,
"MELORAE: He disappeared in the cave at the bottom of the dry lakebed at the north pole. It happened in an instant, and without warning.": 1228,
"MELORAE: I turned away from Coleus to examine a sample, and when I turned back, he simply wasn\u2019t there anymore. He had a limited supply of air, Annona! I\u2019m afraid for him!": 1229,

"ObservatoryIt\u2019s questions like that what make us worried about you going up into space on your own, you know.": 1367,
"ObservatoryThe observatory is up the path behind the waterfall. There are a couple of signs marking the way, but really, you just keep going up and then hook a right when you get to the zero-g cave.": 1368,
"Gneiss3Oh, sure! I made all of their instruments, you know. Let me see... There\u2019s Chert\u2019s drums, Riebeck\u2019s banjo, and Gabbro\u2019s flute.": 1369,
"Gneiss3And Feldspar\u2019s harmonica, of course, though Feldspar\u2019s been missing for a long time. Sometimes it feels like just yesterday they were playing their harmonica around the campfire...": 1370,
"Gneiss3Anyway, you hear music in space, that\u2019ll be one of the space program\u2019s other travelers. If you feel like company, you can always pull out your signalscope and track them down.": 1371,
"GneissSecondaryTrouble is, every time a Hearthian leaves for outer space, that\u2019s one less musician in our orchestra.": 1372,

"GossanCoach1Are you kidding? I\u2019m a natural at this!": 1387,
"Coach2Hey, don\u2019t worry about it. Your nerves are between you, me, and the vast endlessness of space.": 1388,
"Coach2But really, you\u2019ll do fine out there. I\u2019d worry more about that ship, if I were you. Hopefully that lunatic Slate at least fixed the retro rockets.": 1389,
"Coach3Good. Everyone should be a bit nervous going into space. I got cocky during my first flight and nearly put a new crater in the moon.": 1390,
"Coach3Still, I was never as green as you.": 1391,
"GossanCoach3Hey, I\u2019ve gotten better!": 1392,
"GossanCoach3That\u2019s not what Slate says...": 1393,
"Coach4Is that so? Funny, I seem to recall the first time you strapped on a jetpack, we had to come fish you out of the crater near the south pole.": 1394,
"Coach5Oi, you know better than to believe a word that lunatic says about me.": 1395,
"Coach5They\u2019re still sore I made them install a safety harness in the cockpit. Claimed it would \u201cthrow off the thrust-to-weight ratio.\u201d": 1396,
"Coach5Honestly. One of these days I\u2019m gonna throw off <i>Slate\u2019s</i> thrust-to-weight ratio.": 1397,

"Coach7There\u2019s a \u201csatellite\u201d \u2014 which is definitely <i>not</i> just a piece of broken mining equipment \u2014 set up down in the zero-g cave and in need of repairs.": 1399,
"Coach7If you\u2019re looking for a little last-minute zero-g practice, head down the lift and into the cave. Or don\u2019t, so long as you\u2019re confident you can make ship repairs in space.": 1400,

"Coach10Heh. Darn right you are.": 1408,
"Coach10Don\u2019t get yourself killed out there, you hear? Not after I\u2019ve put this much work into training you.": 1409,
"Coach10...Haha, go on, go make Outer Wilds Ventures proud.": 1410,
"Coach11If you changed your mind about practicing ship repairs, head down the lift and into the zero-g cave.": 1411,
"Coach11You just need to maneuver over to the \u201csatellite\u201d and repair each damaged area, same as you\u2019ll be doing for your ship.": 1412,
"Coach12What\u2019s the holdup? That \u201csatellite\u201d isn\u2019t going to repair itself.": 1413,

"HalFriend1The statue looked at me and opened its eyes!": 1422,
"HalFriend1The statue was glowing! Why was it glowing?!": 1423,
"Friend3Whoa, whoa \u2014 the statue was doing <i>what</i>?": 1424,
"Friend3So its eyes opened, and then you saw images from your own memories and glowing lights flying around? You mean like <Pause/> a hallucination?": 1425,
"Friend3Listen, no offense, but... are you sure you\u2019re okay to launch? Like, medically speaking?": 1426,
"HalFriend3You know what, don\u2019t worry about it.": 1427,
"HalFriend3No, that statue is <i>definitely weird</i>.": 1428,
"Friend4Maybe you should sit down for a bit and take it easy. I\u2019d hate for anything bad to happen if you tried to launch while you\u2019re not feeling great.": 1429,
"Friend4But hey, when you <i>are</i> ready, then you can make the most of our translator tool! <color=grey>Sniff...</color><Pause/> I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s all grown up and leaving for space already.": 1430,
"Friend4For real, though, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re the one carrying it and not, like, Riebeck. They\u2019d fall on it for sure.": 1431,
"Friend4Say, if you want to do a short trip to just get your space legs under you, you could check out the ruins on the Attlerock! I\u2019d love to learn what those are.": 1432,
"Friend5I mean, if you\u2019re saying it happened, then... I guess maybe it did. But why?": 1433,
"Friend5Hornfels tried everything to get the statue\u2019s eyes to open, and nothing like this ever happened to them.": 1434,
"Friend5I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get any answers from the museum statue, but Gabbro said they were going back to Giant\u2019s Deep. Dunno which island they\u2019re on, though.": 1435,
"Friend5Maybe they\u2019d be able to tell you more? On the other hand, Gabbro\u2019s, y\u2019know, <i>Gabbro</i>, so maybe you\u2019d be better off searching for more info on your own.": 1436,
"Friend5...Geez, now I\u2019m <i>really</i> jealous you\u2019re going into space! Hey, see if you can use our translator tool to find out more about the statue, okay?": 1437,

"WheresGabbro_OutsideIf you do see Gabbro, say hi for me!": 1448,
"PostConvo2From Giant\u2019s Deep! Gabbro fished it out of the oceans and brought it back here for study.": 1449,
"PostConvo2Hornfels doesn\u2019t know much about it yet, just that it\u2019s <i>crazy</i> old and super tough. I wonder why the Nomai carved it?": 1450,
"PostConvo2Apparently, Gabbro went back to Giant\u2019s Deep to try to learn more about the statue. Maybe they\u2019ll find some answers there.": 1451,
"PostConvo3Good question! You know how Gabbro knocked a fragment off the statue while they were hauling it back from Giant's Deep?": 1452,
"PostConvo3Hornfels analyzed the fragment and figured out the stone it's made from can store information \u2014 I heard Slate ended up repurposing it for your ship\u2019s computer.": 1453,
"PostConvo3I\u2019m not sure what the statue opening its eyes has to do with anything, but maybe the statue was made for storing information, too?": 1454,
"PostConvo4Hey, you never know \u2014 maybe you\u2019ll be the one to uncover the Nomai\u2019s mysteries!": 1455,
"PostConvo4Or maybe you\u2019ll discover a new kind of rock or something.": 1456,

"Riebeck_AttlerockRecordingOkay, wow. <i>Wow.</i> I\u2019ve seen this ruin in other travelers\u2019 pictures, but seeing it for myself...": 1494,
"Riebeck_AttlerockRecordingIt\u2019s <Pause=1><i>really</i> old, isn\u2019t it?": 1495,
"Riebeck_AttlerockRecordingBut wow, this is the coolest day of my life. ...Okay, um, time for some official notes!": 1496,
"Riebeck_AttlerockRecordingSo this is some kind of Nomai \u201clocator.\u201d It can point out the different planets - which is incredibly cool, by the way - but from what little I can understand of the writing here, I think it was built to try to find something specific?": 1497,
"Riebeck_AttlerockRecordingI\u2019m not sure. I also was able to translate something about the south pole of Brittle Hollow, so I\u2019ll fly there to see if I can learn more.": 1498,
"Riebeck_AttlerockRecordingYep. Just gonna get back in the ol\u2019 ship and take off. Totally safe... Mostly safe. <size=20>Oh, stars above</size>...": 1499,
"RiebecksJournalThe journey here from the south pole has been, um... I\u2019m going to go with \u201charrowing\u201d, because of the, um, all of the meteors. But hey, at least I made it here unconcussed and not on fire!": 1500,
"RiebecksJournalOkay, let\u2019s see... I poked around a little, and there\u2019s some sort of old Nomai path that starts across from my campsite, inside the ruined building with trees growing out of it.": 1501,
"RiebecksJournalDoesn\u2019t look like anything horrible - just stairs leading down. I can handle stairs! After I get my supplies together, I\u2019ll follow the path and see where it leads.": 1502,
"RiebecksJournalHurgh. Well. That was... deeply unpleasant. I made it this far, though. Guess that\u2019s the part to focus on, and not how I\u2019ll eventually have to get back <i>up</i> that path.": 1503,
"RiebecksJournalBut wow, this place sure is something! Looks like the Hanging City is north from here. And east is a gravity cannon! I <i>definitely</i> want to see that.": 1504,
"RiebecksJournalAnd another thing - I\u2019m detecting oxygen from somewhere below. Which is good, since I, uh, used up a lot of my supply screaming during the trip down from the surface.": 1505,
"RiebecksJournalAs soon as I stop dry heaving, I\u2019m going to head farther down below so I can refill my tank.": 1506,
"RiebecksJournalAt first I thought this was an old Nomai settlement, but on closer inspection, I don\u2019t think anyone ever lived here. These buildings are atypical for Nomai dwellings.": 1507,
"RiebecksJournalMy best guess? This could be where the Nomai made gravity crystals. We know they mined raw from material from below the crust on Brittle Hollow, then refined that material to produce the crystals.": 1508,
"RiebecksJournalGravity crystals produce a local gravity distortion that affects the area around them, up to a certain radius. They\u2019re very clever! Nomai used them to anchor themselves to surfaces they might want to traverse down.": 1509,
"RiebecksJournalWe Hearthians have borrowed their technology in our ships, where gravity crystals keep astronauts anchored to just one flat plane (thank the stars!).": 1510,
"Riebeck_SouthPoleRecordingI\u2019m here! I did it! I put the ship down safely!": 1511,
"Riebeck_SouthPoleRecordingUm, in that the ship went down, and I didn\u2019t sustain bodily harm. A few minor repairs, and it\u2019s like the ship never even hit those rocks!": 1512,
"Riebeck_SouthPoleRecordingOne of my better attempts. Feldspar would barely have laughed at me, I bet.": 1513,
"Riebeck_SouthPoleRecordingThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news... I, uh, haven\u2019t found a way inside this structure yet. The door is broken, and I know I\u2019m not great at exploring, but I think I would have found a different entrance by now if there were one. P... probably.": 1514,
"Riebeck_SouthPoleRecordingI can\u2019t get inside from <i>here</i>, but I know there are paths below the surface. I\u2019m going to head north to the ruins on the equator to try to find a way down.": 1515,

"Spinel3One time, after the rest of the village had left to sleep and it was just the two of us sitting around the campfire, Gabbro told me about their first trip to Giant\u2019s Deep.": 1547,
"Spinel3They landed their ship easily enough in the waves, but couldn\u2019t see too far down, on account of how murky the water was, I guess. Too dark.": 1548,
"Spinel3Gabbro wants to see what lay beneath the surface, so they decided to travel deeper. They traveled down, and down...": 1549,
"Spinel3But suddenly, Gabbro couldn\u2019t go any further.": 1550,
"SpinelSpinel3Tell me more.": 1551,

"Spinel7As though exercising a will of its own, the water was refusing to let Gabbro go any deeper. It held Gabbro back. ...Almost as if it were trying to protect them from something.": 1557,

"Spinel8Everyone wants to hear new stories at the village campfire, you know. Make sure you bring some back with you!": 1564,
"Spinel9Heard it from Gabbro themself! Gabbro can be a little fanciful, sure, but they aren\u2019t a liar. I mean, probably, anyway.": 1565,

"Intro1Me? I was using the old scout launcher and saw smoke in one of the photos, so I thought I\u2019d come over here myself and take a look.": 1580,
"TektiteIntro1So what crashed?": 1581,
"TektiteIntro1Is that a Dark Bramble seed?": 1582,
"Intro2You again, eh, hatchling? Thought I heard you lift off earlier. What\u2019re you still doing on Timber Hearth?": 1583,
"Intro2Me? I\u2019m out here to see what it was I saw crash over this way. That, and make sure nothing\u2019s on fire.": 1584,
"TektiteIntro2So what crashed?": 1585,
"TektiteIntro2Is that a Dark Bramble seed?": 1586,
"Intro3You again, eh, hatchling? Thought I heard you lift off earlier. What\u2019re you still doing on Timber Hearth?": 1587,

"TektiteIntro3So what crashed?": 1589,
"TektiteIntro3Is that a Dark Bramble seed?": 1590,
"Tektite1I dunno what it is, exactly. Looks like some kind of plant seed, but it\u2019s not anything I\u2019ve seen on Timber Hearth before - and trust me, I was quite the explorer back in the day.": 1591,
"Tektite1D\u2019you think it\u2019s extraterrestrial? It kinda looks like something that might\u2019ve come off of Dark Bramble. Whatever it is, it put down roots in a hurry.": 1592,
"Tektite2You think so? It\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve ever seen on Timber Hearth before, so you\u2019re probably onto something there.": 1593,
"Tektite2Whatever it is, it put down roots in a hurry.": 1594,
"Tektite3I don\u2019t like the look of this thing, hatchling, and that\u2019s a fact. Think I\u2019ll set Marl and Hal loose on it. Best get rid of this mess sooner rather than later, and no one can remove an unwanted plant faster than a tree keeper can.": 1595,
"Tektite3I\u2019ll have to get a look at what\u2019s inside the seed, first, though. Don\u2019t want to set anybody to hacking up a potentially dangerous plant without a better idea of what\u2019s lurking inside there.": 1596,
"Tektite3Tuff can help me haul the old <color=orange>scout launcher</color> over here. Obviously the opening is too small for someone to fit inside, and anyway, I\u2019m not gonna blindly stick my hands into anything that looks as unpleasant as that seed does.": 1597,
"Tektite3That\u2019s a good way to lose an arm or two.": 1598,
"Tektite4Blasted seed did a lot of damage when it crashed. I liked this crater.": 1599,
"Tektite4Need something from me, hatchling?": 1600,
"TektiteTektite4I threw a Little Scout into the seed.": 1601,
"TektiteTektite4My signalscope is picking up a harmonica inside the seed.": 1602,
"TektiteTektite4You\u2019re sure this seed isn\u2019t from Timber Hearth?": 1603,
"TektiteTektite4Nope, I\u2019m good.": 1604,
"Tektite5You did, did you? And you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s bigger on the inside than on the outside?": 1605,
"Tektite5Hmph. This is going to be a chore to chop up, and no mistake. Can we even remove a seed that doesn\u2019t have the decency to stay the same size all the way through?": 1606,
"Tektite5Maybe I\u2019d better grab an extra axe or three, just in case.": 1607,
"Tektite6Inside the seed? Huh. Dunno what to tell you there - the only harmonica player I know is Feldspar, and they disappeared ages ago.": 1608,
"Tektite6Listen here, don\u2019t go telling Gneiss about the harmonica music, okay? They\u2019ll never let me get rid of this darn seed if they suspect it has any musical talent.": 1609,
"Tektite7Back in my younger days, I explored everywhere there is to go on Timber Hearth and saw everything there is to see, and then some. Trust me, we don\u2019t have anything like this.": 1610,

"RiebeckLearned_4Why they chose to build their most advanced settlement so close to a <i>you-know-what</i> is beyond me. Maybe that kind of thing makes sense to a Nomai, though. ...Maybe they needed the <size=20>black hole</size> for something?": 1804,
"RiebeckLearned_5You mean there\u2019s another Nomai city <i>inside</i> of Ember Twin? That\u2019s incredible! A whole city, and I had no idea it existed! This is great!": 1805,
"RiebeckLearned_5How did they keep the sand out? If it were me, I\u2019d be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand. Gosh, the Nomai sure were ingenius, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City! ...Wow!": 1806,
"RiebeckLearned_5That means there were two groups of Nomai \u2014 one that lived on Ember Twin, and one that lived here on Brittle Hollow. But they must have traveled around the solar system, since Nomai writing can be found on other planets, too.": 1807,
"RiebeckLearned_6A pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon? The Nomai mentioned the Quantum Moon in a lot of their writing, so it was clearly special to them. And um, special enough to make a trip there by themselves!": 1808,
"RiebeckLearned_6It sounds like a coming-of-age ritual, like how hatchlings stay hatchlings until their stomachs are strong enough to drink sap wine.": 1809,
"RiebeckLearned_6Maybe once a Nomai journeyed to the Quantum Moon, they were considered an adult?": 1810,

"RiebeckLearned_7But...": 1815,
"RiebeckLearned_7I guess if I hadn\u2019t wanted to learn why the Nomai disappeared, I\u2019d never have left Timber Hearth and come out here, or had any of these adventures.": 1816,
"RiebeckLearned_7...Don\u2019t get me wrong, space is terrifying! But, you know, it has its moments.": 1817,
"RiebeckLearned_8AHHH! That doesn\u2019t make any sense! I don\u2019t understand! I am very excited for you, though! P-please stop yelling!": 1818,
"RiebeckLearned_8...What? On the Quantum Moon, you said?<Pause> There\u2019s a sort of-living Nomai on the Quantum Moon?!": 1819,
"RiebeckLearned_8WELL, WHY DIDN\u2019T YOU SAY SO?!": 1820,
"RiebeckLearned_8Oh wow! <i>Wow</i>! This is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened in the history of Outer Wilds Ventures! I can\u2019t believe you talked to an actual Nomai!": 1821,
"RiebeckLearned_8Great! So I just have to go back into space, fly to the Quantum Moon with zero visibility, find a spooky ruin, and travel through a few different types of dangerous terrain to get there.": 1822,
"RiebeckLearned_8Okay, yeah, that\u2019s... that\u2019s not so bad. <Pause><size=20>That\u2019s probably doable...</size>": 1823,

"HornfelsCurator1I don\u2019t know.": 2295,
"HornfelsCurator1I\u2019m gonna wing it!": 2296,
"Curator2I might have guessed as much! No sense in making a translator tool if you\u2019re not going to use it to translate anything.": 2297,
"Curator2We\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of the Nomai writing in our solar system, so we still know very little about them. We\u2019ve no idea if they originated here or traveled here, or why they disappeared.": 2298,

"Curator4I like it! You\u2019ll have plenty of options to choose from.": 2305,
"Curator4No one\u2019s ever landed on the Interloper before, you know. Perhaps you\u2019ll be the first?": 2306,

"Curator5You\u2019d prefer to ease into things? That\u2019s a sensible plan! More sensible than most of our astronauts tend to be, and that\u2019s a fact.": 2308,
"Curator5Do you think you\u2019ll go to the Attlerock, then? Our moon would be a safe place to travel to and get your bearings in space, and I\u2019m sure Esker would appreciate the visit.": 2309,
"Curator5Plus, we don\u2019t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!": 2310,
"Curator6Haha! Overwhelmed by the options, perhaps? I don\u2019t blame you.": 2311,
"Curator6If you need help getting started, you could go visit Esker on the moon. They\u2019re alone on the Attlerock most of the time, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019d appreciate it.": 2312,
"Curator6Plus, we don\u2019t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!": 2313,
"Curator7Planning to follow in the footsteps of Feldspar and the great Outer Wilds Ventures tradition, are you? I might have guessed.": 2314,
"Curator7Well, see if you can\u2019t put that translator tool of yours to good use while you\u2019re out there!": 2315,
