"Suppose the universe is older than previously assumed.": 4,
"The <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> requires a powerful, highly advanced warp core. How should we obtain it?": 5,
"Solution 2: We could craft a new advanced warp core inspired by the <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s warp core.": 6,
"OENO: The greatest challenge here, I think, is we don’t have the design for such a powerful core, or any of the original crafters of the <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s core.": 7,
"CLARY: No, but Poke was apprenticed to Annona, who created the original design, and our <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color> is adept at crafting simpler cores.": 8,
"POKE: I believe I can be of use here! The <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s warp core was created before my time, but Annona explained many of his designs to me.": 9,
"IDAEA: This is the safest path for our clan.": 10,
"AVENS: Is the safest path the best one? Our goal is worth the risk.": 11,
"CASSAVA: Is it, though? We’ve tried for so long to find something that I (and others) now believe might be impossible to find. If the search for the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is a futile one, we should choose the option with the least potential for harm.": 12,
"SPIRE: Abandoning the <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s warp core and its casing means losing valuable knowledge.": 13,
"MITIS: This is true; however, it’s knowledge we have little hope of recovering. It would be best to relearn, I think.": 14,
"POKE: I would very much like to craft such a powerful core! More relevantly, I believe the <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color> crew and I could recreate the basic design.": 15,
"CASSAVA: I imagine I’ve been hard on Poke, again. This in turn means I’ve made things difficult for her sister (Clary).": 16,
"CASSAVA: If Poke and I are oil and water, Clary is our emulsifier. She certainly makes us a better team than would mixing through shaking (although sometimes I would like to shake Poke!).": 17,
"CASSAVA: Jokes aside, suppose my own fear of never finding the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> prompted my argument with Poke. That would be immature of me.": 18,
"CASSAVA: I should apologize... At least to Clary, who could then tell Poke.": 19,
"POKE: I feel strange, trying to recreate Annona’s warp core without him. At times, it still feels strange to no longer be his (very young) apprentice, and for the <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color> to be in my care and not his.": 20,
"POKE: Hypothesis: This will always feel strange. Even though my time with him was short, I miss my old mentor, and deeply.": 21,
"POKE: To have the chance to try is thrilling, but... I don’t want to disappoint everyone. I <i>think</i> I can do this (probably), but what if excitement has clouded my assessment of my own abilities?": 22,
"POKE: Was I wrong in volunteering to build it...? I was born in this star system, and never saw Annona’s warp core with my own three eyes. I only know what he taught me. What if I’ve bitten off a larger portion than I can consume?": 23,
"POKE: Still, all I can give is my best. And as Annona would say, should my best prove insufficient, then we will find another way to achieve what’s needed. I have Clary and Root in the forge, and I have my clan. I am not alone!": 24,
"SOLANUM: Formation Of This Universe": 25,
"SOLANUM: No one knows how this universe was made, but one thing we do know is everything used to be very hot and very dense (tightly packed together).": 26,
"SOLANUM: As this early universe expanded, it also cooled down. Once it had cooled down enough, particles were able to group together to form things like galaxies, stars, and planets!": 27,
"SOLANUM: Since then, space has continued to expand at a faster and faster rate, which is hard to think about for too long without your brain hurting.": 28,
"SOLANUM: This universe will keep getting colder and larger, until one day, the stars and the life they support will all die.": 29,

"LAMI: We can’t go because we’re stuck here. But Filix says we used to go, too.": 34,
"LAMI: At some festivals, one clan’s big discovery can mean all the Nomai get to advance, too. Like Annona’s warp core, which made it so everyone can warp long distances and explore more.": 35,

"CONOY: Spire and I are crafting a model to determine why this happened.": 45,
"SPIRE: An update: It’s now clear there are two different types of cyclone.": 46,
"SPIRE: Most cyclones on <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color> rotate clockwise. These are the cyclones Cassava typically uses to send components into orbit.": 47,
"SPIRE: There also exists a rarer type of cyclone that spins the opposite direction and pushes objects beneath the waters and below the current.": 48,
"CASSAVA: My gratitude, Spire. Conoy is showing me your handiwork, and I’m intrigued by this secondary type of cyclone. But was it really necessary to build a model to tell me that?": 49,

"BELLS: We make this journey not only for ourselves, but also to honor the members of our clan who came before us: those who, after the crash that brought them to this star system, became stranded on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color> and on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>, with no communication between these two groups of survivors.": 66,
"BELLS: These Nomai looked upward from two different planets and saw the same wandering moon visiting their skies. It was this moon (the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>) that kept their curiosity alive during this long period of hardship.": 67,
"BELLS: After the two divided groups were able to reunite, it became our clan’s united goal to find and visit the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>. This took time, and many Nomai who dreamed of seeing the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color> died before we discovered how to make the journey.": 68,

"THATCH: Plume is right; the trees <i>do</i> move! I confess I didn’t notice until I read his notes.": 72,
"THATCH: Alarmingly, it isn’t only the trees: There is other matter in this area (such as that unusual shard of rock) moving in this same eerie way.": 73,
"FILIX: That rock is unusual for another reason, too, Thatch: It possesses color and texture I’ve never seen elsewhere on this planet!": 74,
"FILIX: Hypothesis: This rock shard’s presence is significant. We should study it! (Could it be what is causing other nearby objects to also move about this area?)": 75,
"THATCH: Plume, Filix, and I have determined this atypical shard of rock is the reason objects in this grove are behaving in a quantum manner.": 76,
"THATCH: The only other object we’ve observed displaying this quantum behavior is the <color=lightblue>wandering moon</color>. I imagine the moon’s behavior and this grove’s are related.": 77,
"PLUME: In her note from earlier, Filix mentions this strange type of rock isn’t found elsewhere on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>. What if it isn’t originally from this planet?": 78,
"PLUME: Hypothesis: This “quantum shard” is from the <color=lightblue>wandering (quantum) moon</color>. Perhaps it is even a small piece of the moon itself.": 79,
"FILIX: Of note: A unique signal is coming from this shard! Curiously, our friend the <color=lightblue>wandering moon</color> sounds the same.": 80,
"FILIX: I’ve also heard the same signal this shard produces calling out from <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color>,<color=lightblue>Timber Hearth</color>, and the <color=lightblue>Hourglass Twins</color>. Suppose there are other shards like this one!": 81,
"BELLS: Welcome, Solanum! Your arrival here means you’ve completed your preparations on <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color> and are ready to depart for the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>.": 82,

"MELORAE: When our <color=orange>escape pod</color> punctured this planet’s surface, it broke into what scans show is a cave system with much cooler air. I <i>would</i> recommend we seek a site down there to build a long-term shelter, Annona, but these passages are a maze!": 104,
"ANNONA: Even with this danger, they are still our best chance for survival. We’ll form teams and descend into the caves to look for a shelter site. We can mark our findings on the walls to avoid becoming irreversibly lost.": 105,
"ANNONA: Be cautious, everyone.": 106,
"RHUS: And be aware of the sand as you search. It appears to be rising gradually.": 107,
"COLEUS: The path to the shelter site is somewhat convoluted, so follow the instructions ahead closely!": 108,
"COLEUS: To reach the shelter site, walk forward until you meet the sandfall at the pit, then turn left. Continue to the room filled with rock column formations and climb upward through the opening above them.": 109,
"COLEUS: The sand here is rising, so you must be cautious but swift.": 110,
"COLEUS: Be cautious crossing the chasm ahead. The bridge Melorae and I crafted will do its job, but it isn’t strong.": 111,
"COLEUS: Once on the far side, look for the tunnel hidden behind the falling sand. Follow it, and you’ll reach the shelter site.": 112,
"COLEUS: You’re doing well! There’s only a little farther left to go now until you reach the shelter site. You can rest there. Hurry, before the sand comes!": 113,
"MELORAE: Do not follow this tunnel to its end! (Coleus and I will examine the horror that lies at its terminus later, provided we live through this.)": 114,
"ANNONA: Of note: This passage leads to breathable air. Refill your supply tank there (we cannot tell how far or deep these tunnels may wind), but do not linger, as the area is exposed to the heat of this alien <color=lightblue>sun</color>.": 115,
"ANNONA: Refill your air supply tank and return quickly.": 116,

"CLARY: I understand, but... Be cautious, both of you.": 142,
"POKE: The spherical stone casing here seems to be the source of the energy readings... No, rather, the source is what’s within the stone. I’m detecting some form of exotic matter.": 143,
"PYE: The stone is <i>muting</i> our energy readings; they should be ten times what we’re seeing, at least.": 144,
"POKE: Pye, I don’t think we want this matter interacting with us. As far as I can tell, direct contact with it would almost certainly be fatal.": 145,
"PYE: I’ve never encountered anything like this casing, but it’s all that’s protecting us from what’s inside. Worse still, this matter is disturbingly volatile.": 146,
"POKE: ...Pye. Whatever the matter inside this stone casing is, it’s more than just profoundly unstable; it’s under tonnes of pressure. Look at this density scan. I’ve never seen <i>anything</i> this tightly compacted before! What <i>is</i> this?": 147,
"PYE: This is orders of magnitude worse than I’d imagined. If this stone were to rupture, the lethal matter within would rapidly expand, completely blanketing this star system almost instantaneously. And the pressure is still building as the <color=lightblue>comet</color> approaches this star system...": 148,

"POKE: What are you doing, Pye?!": 150,
"PYE: The more we know about this alien matter, the better our chances of survival. I will learn what I can here. Go, warn the others; maybe they can construct shelter somehow. ...<i>Now</i>, Poke!": 151,
"CLARY: I fear our situation may be dire:": 152,
"CLARY: Pye, Poke, and I landed here on this <color=lightblue>comet</color> not long after its arrival in this star system. Our <color=orange>shuttle</color>’s equipment heard strange energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface.": 153,
"CLARY: Pye and Poke were able to locate a fissure in the ice on the <color=lightblue>comet</color>’s sunward side, and they descended inside to investigate the source of the readings.": 154,
"CLARY: But... Pye and my sister have been gone for a long time now. They haven’t contacted me since descending below the surface, either.": 155,
"CLARY: Should I leave the <color=orange>shuttle</color> to look for them? I want to follow protocol, but I don’t know what I’ll do if they aren’t well...": 156,
"CLARY: Poke... Pye... Come back to me safely, my friends.": 157,
"CLARY: This is troublesome: It seems the <color=lightblue>comet</color> wishes to submerge our <color=orange>shuttle</color> in ice. If we stay on the surface too long, the <color=orange>shuttle</color> may freeze entirely.": 158,
"POKE: Even if it did, couldn’t someone call it back home to the <color=orange>gravity cannon</color> on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>?": 159,
"PYE: Yes, but the exploration of the <color=lightblue>comet</color> would be more difficult if we were without the <color=orange>shuttle</color> until someone recalled it. Perhaps we shouldn’t have landed on the dark side of the <color=lightblue>comet</color>...": 160,
"CLARY: Suppose one of us remained in the <color=orange>shuttle</color> to keep it warm and continue monitoring the surface.": 161,

"CLARY: Regarding the warp towers on <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>: Does each tower have to be perfectly aligned with the center of the astral body to which it’s tuned?": 310,
"CLARY: I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, but if, for example, a tower’s base were to shift even slightly, that tower might no longer align with its astral body.": 311,
"POKE: We don’t need the alignment angle to be exact; it only needs to be within five degrees of the astral body’s center.": 312,
"POKE: Of note: This gives us a slightly longer warp window. I imagine this window will last roughly several seconds.": 313,
"POKE: As such, any Nomai stepping onto the warp platform during the active window will be immediately warped. We will need to be careful around the platform for the duration of the time it’s active to avoid accidental transportation.": 314,
"CLARY: More accurately, I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, provided the next Nomai is not Poke.": 315,

"GabbroMeetGabbro3FNo, it’s me, too. We’re in a time loop.": 370,

"Gabbro3F_3Heh, right back at you.": 374,

"Gabbro3F_4I figured it’d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn’t really thinking about what’s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let’s go with “loop” for now.": 376,
"Gabbro3F_5It looks like you and I are the only ones who can tell that time’s gone all weird. I tried radioing Hornfels and asking if they’d died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical.": 377,
"Gabbro3F_5Even if I tell Hornfels about the time loop, they never remember by the next one. They don’t realize anything’s different.": 378,
"Gabbro3F_5And here’s another weird one for you - every time I die, all of my memories from that loop replay back to me. I’m pretty sure that’s related to this big stone Nomai statue I found on one of the other islands.": 379,
"Gabbro3F_5I was looking at it, and the statue opened its eyes and started glowing. It replayed my memories like it’d seen them through my own eyes, just like what happens each time I die.": 380,
"GabbroGabbro3F_5That happened to me with the statue at the museum.": 381,
"Gabbro3F_6You too, huh? Then the Nomai statues must have something to do with why we’re the only ones aware of the time loop. So... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?": 382,
"Gabbro3F_6I think that’s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I’ll be here.": 383,
"Gabbro3F_6Anyway, that’s what’s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! ...Kind of! Let’s talk about you, you know?": 384,

"WhatAreYouDoing_3FBut I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.": 397,
"WhatAreYouDoing_3FI mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful.": 398,
"WhereToExplore_3FHere’s something you might like — I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky at the start of every loop. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet.": 399,
"WhereToExplore_3FWhat else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the <i>island</i> where I found the glowing Nomai <i>statue</i>.<Pause> ...Get it?": 400,
"WhereToExplore_3FI was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale.": 401,
"WhereToExplore_3FIf you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see.": 402,
"ThisPlanet_3FHaha, I know, right?": 403,
"ThisPlanet_3F...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there.": 404,
"ThisPlanet_3FThere’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.": 405,
"ThisPlanet_3FAs for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach.": 406,
"ThisPlanet_3FYou’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip — if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you.": 407,
"GabbrosShipThat’s a good question.": 408,
"GabbrosShipIt’s definitely on this planet <i>some</i>where. I mean, unless a cyclone came by and tossed it into space, I guess. Heh, that would be pretty nuts.": 409,
"GabbrosShipI hope it’s not lonely.": 410,
"GabbrosShip2An excellent question. I haven’t seen it around lately.": 411,
"GabbrosShip2I hope it’s not lonely.": 412,

"GabbrosShip3Did it look like it was having a good time?": 414,
"GabbrosShip4I hope it’s having fun! Did you say hi for me?": 415,
"GoodbyeCool, cool. Take it easy out there.": 416,
"FoundSomethingMenuNice, nice. Whatcha got for me?": 417,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI reached the inside of Statue Island.": 418,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found the source of the time loop.": 419,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found Nomai masks inside the Ash Twin Project.": 420,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found what happened to the Orbital Probe Cannon.": 421,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found your quantum poem.": 422,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuI found a photo of you inside the old radio tower.": 423,
"GabbroFoundSomethingMenuActually, nevermind.": 424,
"FoundSomething1_3FSo the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing.": 425,
"FoundSomething1_3FDo you think the statues are recording our memories, then? ’Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!": 426,
"FoundSomething1bRight, right, the cavern inside Statue Island is where the memory-recording statues were made, I remember.": 427,
"FoundSomething1bSo your memory statue is the one in the museum back in the crater, and mine’s the one I found on the beach. I kinda dig having my own personal memory-friend.": 428,
"FoundSomething1bIf you come up with any hunches about what the Nomai wanted to record memories for, feel free to run them by me! You know where I’ll be.": 429,
"FoundSomething2_3FWait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is <i>wild</i>.": 430,
"FoundSomething2_3FNow we know what’s causing the loop, then. And... if it’s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh...": 431,
"FoundSomething2_3FHey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there’s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn’t, what with the sun blowing up and all.": 432,
"FoundSomething2_3FThen again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?": 433,
"FoundSomething2_3F...I dunno, I’m no time loop expert. I’m just gonna sit here and ponder the intricacies of time and space. Maybe take a nap, too, if I feel like it.": 434,
"FoundSomething2bMy head’s still all full of scenarios for what would happen if you turned off the time loop. I’ll probably notice if you decide to mess with it, though, right? Seems like something I’d notice.": 435,
"FoundSomething2bThis is all pretty wild.": 436,
"FoundSomething3_3FYou’re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through.": 437,
"FoundSomething3_3FWait, then it’s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?": 438,
"FoundSomething3_3FThat’s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven’t, because technically the loops never happened.": 439,
"FoundSomething3_3FMeaning we’re receiving memories of things that will never happen to us. Cool, huh?": 440,
"FoundSomething3bRight, you told me earlier that the point of the statues is to send memories back in time. Which I guess makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through.": 441,
"FoundSomething3bI thought about it some more, and I think that means our minds have gone through all these loops, but we haven’t actually gone through them ourselves.": 442,
"FoundSomething3bMeaning we’re receiving memories of things that technically will never happen to us. Cool, huh?": 443,
"FoundSomething4_3FWhoa, that’s the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop? For real?": 444,
"FoundSomething4_3FDid you figure out why?": 445,
"GabbroFoundSomething4_3FToo much power.": 446,
"GabbroFoundSomething4_3FOverenthusiasm.": 447,
"FoundSomething4FollowUp_3F...It’s kind of scary how much that sounds like something Slate or Feldspar would do. I’m pretty surprised the Nomai built something that actually broke!": 448,
"FoundSomething4FollowUp_3FCome to think of it, though, “broke” might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop.": 449,
"FoundSomething4b_3FSo the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I’m seeing fall from the sky every loop.": 450,
"FoundSomething4b_3FI’m still surprised the Nomai built something that isn’t holding together, you know? Them being genius crafters and all.": 451,
"FoundSomething4b_3FOn the other hand, maybe we should be impressed they made something that could last until modern day in the first place. And it looks like the cannon is still firing successfully at the start of each time loop.": 452,
"FoundSomething5_3FYeah, the one in the woods, I remember writing that. Pretty fun, right? It works out to a good 24 poems.": 453,
"FoundSomething5_3FWhen I’m done exploring, I want to make some more quantum art. Maybe some kind of creature sculpture that just, like, shows up and scares the daylights out of you.": 454,
"FoundSomething6AgainYeah, you mentioned that before. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy.": 455,
"FoundSomething6BaseNice. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy.": 456,
"FoundSomething6Must have been from the time Hornfels sent me to check on the deep space satellite. They thought Ol’ Spacey might be malfunctioning, but I couldn’t find a single thing wrong with it.": 457,
"FoundSomething6Which is probably how it got a shot of my beautiful be-helmeted face, come to think of it.": 458,
"FoundSomething6I always thought it was kinda sweet that the best way to find Ol’ Spacey is to use a map that’s generated by the satellite itself, isn’t it? Like it’s inviting us to visit. Good ol’ deep space satellite, always making sure we know where we’re going.": 459,
"GabbroFoundSomething6Why’d Hornfels think it was broken?": 460,
"GabbroFoundSomething6Um. “Ol’ Spacey”?": 461,
"GabbroFoundSomething6I have a map?!": 462,
"FoundSomething6aDunno. Hornfels probably told me why, but Hornfels tells me lots of things, and sometimes I tune out. Or pretend there’s signal interference and I can’t hear them.": 463,
"FoundSomething6aBest guess says the deep space satellite must have sent Timber Hearth some weird pictures, but like… what’s considered “weird” for a satellite, you know?": 464,
"FoundSomething6aAnyway, if you ever want to visit Ol’ Spacey, fastest way is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to the satellite, same as you would any astral body.": 465,
"FoundSomething6bI mean, the satellite’s not <i>super</i> old, but it’s hardly brand-new. “Ol’” is more a term of affection. ...You’re being very literal-minded about this.": 466,
"FoundSomething6bOl’ Spacey likes visitors, you know! Fastest way to find it is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to our faithful satellite friend, same as you would any astral body.": 467,
"FoundSomething6cYeah, um, the one that’s standard with all our spacesuits? The one you have with you at all times that opens with the press of a button? …That map?": 468,
"FoundSomething6cYou didn’t get conked on the head by a rock or a meteorite or something on your way here, did you? No shame in that. Happens to me all the time!": 469,
"FoundSomething6cIn case you were hit especially hard, don’t forget that you can jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to any astral body. It’s the easiest way to visit Ol’ Spacey, too.": 470,

"Gabbro3T_1I was hoping you’d be back - something <i>really</i> weird is going on.": 472,
"GabbroGabbro3T_1Do you think we’re in a time loop?": 473,
"GabbroGabbro3T_1We’re definitely in a time loop.": 474,
"Gabbro3T_2Yeah, a time loop makes the most sense, right? Or at least, it’s some kind of fidgety time business. Hard to say what’s happening to the shape of time, exactly, but let’s go with “loop” for now.": 475,
"Gabbro3T_3Oh. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool.": 476,
"GabbroGabbro3T_3You’re taking this pretty well.": 477,
"GabbroGabbro3T_3What did you think it was?": 478,
"Gabbro3T_4Heh, right back at you. Personally, I like new experiences, and I’ve never been in a time loop before.": 479,
"Gabbro3T_4Well. I don’t <i>think</i> I’ve been in a time loop before this one, but then, it’s not like I can know that for sure.": 480,
"Gabbro3T_5I figured it’d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn’t really thinking about what’s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let’s go with “loop” for now.": 481,
"Gabbro3T_6So it looks like you and I are the only ones who know we’re in a time loop. And even if you tell them about it, no one remembers by the next loop. What’s with that?": 482,
"Gabbro3T_6Maybe it’s because we both made some seriously intense eye contact with a Nomai statue?": 483,
"Gabbro3T_6I’m seeing my memories replay each time I die, just like I did when the Nomai statue on the beach opened its eyes and looked at me. So maybe... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?": 484,
"Gabbro3T_6I think that’s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I’ll be here.": 485,

"GabbroMenuSo what’s new?": 487,
"WhatAreYouDoing_3TWell, what are any of us doing here, really?": 488,
"WhatAreYouDoing_3T...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.": 489,
"WhatAreYouDoing_3TBut I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.": 490,
"WhatAreYouDoing_3TI mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful.": 491,
"WhereToExplore_3THere’s something you might like — I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky at the start of every loop. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet.": 492,

"ThisPlanet_3THaha, I know, right?": 496,
"ThisPlanet_3T...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there.": 497,
"ThisPlanet_3TThere’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.": 498,

"FoundSomething2_3THey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there’s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn’t, what with the sun blowing up and all.": 505,
"FoundSomething2_3TThen again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?": 506,
"FoundSomething2_3T...I dunno, I’m no time loop expert. I’m just gonna sit here and ponder the intricacies of time and space. Maybe take a nap, too, if I feel like it.": 507,
"FoundSomething3_3TYou’re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through.": 508,
"FoundSomething3_3TWait, then it’s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?": 509,
"FoundSomething3_3TThat’s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven’t, because technically the loops never happened.": 510,

"FoundSomething4_3TWhoa, that’s the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop? For real?": 512,

"FoundSomething4FollowUp_3TCome to think of it, though, “broke” might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop.": 517,
"FoundSomething4b_3TSo the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I’m seeing fall from the sky every loop.": 518,
"FoundSomething4b_3TI’m still surprised the Nomai built something that isn’t holding together, you know? Them being genius crafters and all.": 519,
"FoundSomething4b_3TOn the other hand, maybe we should be impressed they made something that could last until modern day in the first place. And it looks like the cannon is still firing successfully at the start of each time loop.": 520,

"SlateSlate_ShipLog_1Use the ship log to mark a location I want to revisit. Got it.": 662,

"FeldsparFeldspar3“Got stuck”? But aren’t you the greatest pilot in Hearthian history?": 697,
"Feldspar4Depends on how long “all this time” is. I’ve been here a while, I guess. Ever since I crashed my ship into — that is, ever since my daring escape from the jaws of an anglerfish!": 698,

"FeldsparFeldspar4You crashed your ship, didn’t you.": 700,
"Feldspar4aHaha, you flatter me!<Pause> ...I <i>like</i> it!": 701,
"Feldspar4b<i>Obviously</i>, yes. No need to be rude.": 702,
"Feldspar5...well, like I said, I crash. Blammo! On impact, my ship starts making noises like it’s coming apart from the inside, and I think, well, that ain’t great. Sure enough, I barely get out of there before the electrical systems start sparking like crazy.": 703,
"Feldspar5It’s either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and my poor, fried ship.": 704,
"Feldspar5I camped out near where I crashed at first. I found this skeleton later — great find, would’ve been stupid not to use it.": 705,
"Feldspar5So I moved my setup over here and planted my emergency tree seeds. Been here ever since!": 706,
"FeldsparFeldspar5...Wow.": 707,
"FeldsparFeldspar5I can’t believe you didn’t die.": 708,
"FeldsparFeldspar5I can’t believe you destroyed your ship.": 709,
"FeldsparFeldspar5No wonder there are so many stories about you back home!": 710,
"Feldspar5aMy story goes like this. I’d just finished exploring the core of Giant’s Deep, and I wanted to try my hand at Dark Bramble, seeing as no one had ever been before.": 711,
"Feldspar5aGetting around in Dark Bramble was easy, mind you. Once you’ve dodged one massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, you’ve dodged ’em all.": 712,
"Feldspar5aBut after a while, I run into this huge anglerfish — you’ve seen ’em? Big gnarly things, and this was the biggest one I’ve ever seen. I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off — nothing too fancy. I’m going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and...": 713,
"Feldspar5bOh, this is a good story. I’d just finished exploring the core of Giant’s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever been inside Dark Bramble, so I think, hey, let’s give that a try.": 714,

"Feldspar5cI came to Dark Bramble for the excitement. I’d just finished exploring the core of Giant’s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever gone farther than Dark Bramble’s ice fields, so I thought, hey, let’s give it a try.": 718,
"Feldspar5cI’ve been cruising around for a while, dodging the odd massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, when I run into this huge anglerfish, the biggest I’ve ever seen.": 719,

"Feldspar6aYeah, pretty much.": 721,
"Feldspar6bYou know, in the old days, I used to think the same thing every time I came back from a flight in one piece.": 722,
"Feldspar6bThese days, I’m used to it.": 723,
"Feldspar6cEasy for you to say. Your ship probably has all kinds of fancy modifications and upgrades, like “working retro boosters” and “non-flammable construction materials.”": 724,
"Feldspar6dHeh. You’re not half-bad yourself, making it here in one piece.": 725,
"Feldspar7Anyway, that’s how it all went down, hatchling!": 726,
"Feldspar7Story’s over, but feel free to stay and enjoy the fire a while.": 727,

"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuWhere’s your ship?": 735,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuWhat happened to this anglerfish?": 736,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuShouldn’t I tell ground control to come get you?": 737,
"FeldsparFeldsparPrimaryMenuNah, I’m good.": 738,
"FeldsparSecondaryHey, hatchling, pull up a marshmallow stick!": 739,

"FeldsparFeldsparSecondaryNah, I’m good.": 747,
"FeldsparFishOh, the skeleton? It was like this when I got here.": 748,
"FeldsparFishAs near as I can tell, this anglerfish must have been chewing on the vine and eaten a seed, and then the seed grew and grew in the poor fish’s stomach until... this happened.": 749,
"FeldsparFishGross, huh?": 750,
"FeldsparFishThis skeleton was a good find. Keeps the fish away. See, they’re territorial, so they mostly avoid each other. That’s why I set up camp here.": 751,
"FeldsparCoreGiant’s Deep’s core, huh? Ahhh, that was a wild one.": 752,
"FeldsparCoreBut since you’re asking, I gotta assume you haven’t made it down there yourself yet, right? If I tell you how, it kinda feels like cheating.": 753,
"FeldsparCoreHm...": 754,
"FeldsparCore...On a <i>completely unrelated</i> note, that sure was a big, hollow vine my ship crashed into.<Pause=3> Yep.": 755,
"FeldsparCoreIf I were you, I’d go take a walk and see where it ends.": 756,
"FeldsparCoreYou’ll want to go to the tail end of this anglerfish skeleton here and look for a flickering light in the fog — that’ll be my old ship. Path starts there.": 757,
"FeldsparGoodIf you change your mind, you know where to find me!": 758,
"FeldsparRescueWell... yeah, sure, whenever you have the time.": 759,
"FeldsparRescueFrankly, I kinda like it out here. Quiet, peaceful...ish.": 760,
"FeldsparRescueYou’re a little young to understand, but it’s a lot of pressure, being the best that ever was. Been nice to have a break.": 761,
"FeldsparExploreThat’s the spirit!": 762,
"FeldsparExploreAnywhere’s good, but you should know that space is weird here. Intensely.": 763,
"FeldsparExploreEver tried throwing your scout into one of these weird seeds? See there, with the little opening? It’s just big enough to launch one through.": 764,
"FeldsparExploreYour scout tracker will tell you the scout is in two places at once, but I don’t think that’s... wrong, exactly, because space doesn’t work right in here. That seed looks small, see? But inside, it’s bigger.": 765,
"FeldsparExplore<i>Much</i> bigger.": 766,
"FeldsparExploreI’ve had a lot of time to think about this, and my theory is space in Dark Bramble kind of expands as you go through each sphere. That’s why it’s bigger inside those seeds.": 767,
"FeldsparExploreWell, that’s my theory. Keep that in mind while you’re exploring Dark Bramble and maybe you won’t get lost inside forever.": 768,
"FeldsparExploreGood luck!": 769,
"FeldsparShipwreckNot far from here, as a matter of fact! If you go straight past the tail of this anglerfish skeleton here, you’ll see a flickering light in the fog.": 770,
"FeldsparShipwreckFollow that, and you’ll find my old ship.<Pause> What’s left of it, anyway.": 771,
"FoundSomethingMenuLay it on me, hatchling!": 772,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuI went to the core of Giant’s Deep.": 773,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuI found the frozen jellyfish near your ship.": 774,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuI found the Anglerfish nest.": 775,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuI found a Dark Bramble seed on Timber Hearth.": 776,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuI found Nomai writing saying anglerfish are blind.": 777,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuI found a Nomai shuttle and flew it!": 778,
"FeldsparFoundSomethingMenuActually, nevermind.": 779,
"FoundSomething1So you figured out the ol’ tornado trick, did you? Good work!": 780,
"FoundSomething1I found that bit out by accident, but let’s keep that between you and me, hey? Hornfels would have my very handsome head if they knew I’d been riding the cyclones again.": 781,
"FoundSomething1“The ship is fragile! It can break! You can’t subject it to extreme conditions!” Not like I was flying the thing into the sun, now, was I?": 782,
"FoundSomething1And the jellyfish, you figured those out, too? Hatchling, I tell you what, you’ve done real well for yourself! You’re a fine astronaut, sure, but you might just become a pilot yet!": 783,
"FoundSomething2Ha! So the old thing still there, is it? That’s where I first camped out after the crash, you know. It was pretty cozy inside!": 784,
"FoundSomething2It does lack the structural integrity and indomitable spirit of a camp made in the shelter of the very bones of the species that tried to eat you, I suppose.": 785,
"FoundSomething2Still. Very cozy.": 786,
"FoundSomething3So that’s where the blasted things come from, is it? Stars above, if I still had a working ship, I’d be sorely tempted to go show ’em what’s what!": 787,
"FoundSomething3<color=grey>Sigh...</color>": 788,
"FoundSomething3Probably best to leave ’em alone, though, really. More trouble than it’s worth to mess with anglerfish.": 789,
"FoundSomething4...That’s bad business, hatchling.": 790,
"FoundSomething4As Chert will tell you if you so much as glance in Dark Bramble’s direction, there used to be a fifth planet where the Bramble is now.": 791,
"FoundSomething4This infernal plant appeared at the center and kept growing, and growing, and growing, until it shattered the planet and scattered its pieces across space.": 792,
"FoundSomething4If we don’t get that seed you found sorted real quicklike, I suspect Timber Hearth will be heading toward the same fate. And I tell you what, we Hearthians have overcome far too much to be done in by some worthless <i>seed</i>.": 793,
"FoundSomething5A-<i>ha</i>! So the blasted things <i>do</i> have a weakness!": 794,
"FoundSomething5Meaning my fly-as-fast-as-I-can approach to dealing with them could have used a bit more thought behind it.": 795,
"FoundSomething5Ah, well, at least they didn’t eat me. All’s well that ends well, eh, hatchling?": 796,
"FoundSomething7You flew a Nomaian shuttle? You don’t say! How was it? How did it handle?": 797,
"FoundSomething7Can’t say I’d mind having a go at that myself, hatchling. Once I return to Timber Hearth, maybe that’ll have to be my next stop.": 798,

"Melorae: We were examining the different rocks. I recall Coleus standing on the largest one (the wandering rock). I was taking notes, and then my lantern died.": 919,
"Melorae: When I lit it again, Coleus and the rock were both gone.": 920,
"Should we build the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> to power the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>?": 921,
"IDAEA: I almost can’t comprehend this is being suggested seriously. The purpose of the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> goes against every standard we hold ourselves to and everything we believe in as a species!": 922,
"PYE: Unsurprisingly, Idaea, I disagree. We’re pushing a possible new technology further than ever before. That, in my experience, is the defining characteristic of our species.": 923,
"YARROW: Are there other ways to generate this level of power?": 924,
"PYE: Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. I can’t imagine discovering them in our lifetimes...": 925,
"RAMIE: I understand this proposal is unsettling, but the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> must be built if we hope to complete the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>.": 926,
"COLEUS: If we fail (and the probability of this is not insignificant), we will without question destroy ourselves, all life here, and the rest of this star system. I wish to protect these species.": 927,
"IDAEA: The potential annihilation of an entire star system is too severe a cost. We shouldn’t build the <color=orange>Sun Station</color>, no matter how badly we want the knowledge that comes with it.": 928,
"POKE: Fear of failure is a poor reason not to try. I believe, if we’re cautious, the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will work. I believe in Pye.": 929,
"PYE: Poke, I’m deeply honored. Idaea, I comprehend your position; however, if we aren’t all but certain the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will not cause destruction once we’ve built it, then I won’t support the station’s use.": 930,
"RAMIE: Note: This door will need to remain closed for some <i>time</i>! Pye and I are running an experiment based on the extraordinary findings from the <color=orange>White Hole Station</color>.": 931,
"PYE: Ramie and I will be running this experiment until one of us (specifically, me) can prove the other wrong, so although it’s inconvenient, the lab currently can only be accessed by the path from the <color=orange>Sunless City</color>.": 932,
"RAMIE: Inviting sand inside would disrupt our setup and could have enormous consequences. (We realize this is an intriguing prospect, but the door must remain closed nonetheless!)": 933,
"RAMIE: An update: The <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color> is now being used to design the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>! If you’re here to help (or even just to observe), be sure to use the <color=orange>Sunless City</color> path to the lab.": 934,
"RAMIE: The <color=orange>Southern Observatory</color> is asking if creating a 22 minute interval is possible (that is, to have something arrive 22 minutes before it is actually sent through the warp).": 935,
"RAMIE: We’ve learned the negative interval of time between departure and arrival can be increased by adding more energy to the warp core. Problematically, the energy required to extend the interval increases at an exponential rate.": 936,
"PYE: Hypothesis: Creating a 22-minute-long interval is possible, but we are currently unable to generate the necessary energy.": 937,
"PYE: Ramie and I believe it would be necessary to invent a new method of producing energy, a thrilling but enormous undertaking. We would also require advanced warp technology able to handle such energy.": 938,
"PYE: We would also likely need an enormous space to fit these proposed new energy and warp technologies together. The only location large enough would be <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>.": 939,
"RAMIE: The energy is <i>currently</i> unavailable, you say? You’re a gas, Pye!": 940,
"PYE: My pun was unintended, Ramie, so I believe it’s you who’s aeriform!": 941,
"PYE: Records show Nomai arriving at the warp receiver on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color> very slightly before departing from the <color=orange>White Hole Station</color>. Ramie and I are devising an experiment to test if this is a real phenomenon or simple machine error.": 942,
"RAMIE: In theory, what we want to try to reproduce is a negative amount of time elapsing between something entering the black hole and exiting the white hole at its destination.": 943,
"PYE: Initial things first: Our experiment setup will first pair a small black hole core with a small white hole core to mimic the setup on the <color=orange>White Hole Station</color>.": 944,
"RAMIE: Hypothesis: It is possible for an object to exit a white hole before entering the corresponding black hole.": 945,
"RAMIE: An update: Our experiment here reproduced the anomaly in arrival and departure times, but Pye is unconvinced it’s more than an equipment error. I hope to strengthen the effect to render it visible to the unaided eyes.": 946,
"PYE: To that end, we’ve decided to try adding more energy. I imagine the <color=orange>Sunless City</color>’s energy supply should prove sufficient.": 947,
"PYE: Of note, Ramie: Yarrow requests that we let him know before we reroute energy to the experiment.": 948,
"RAMIE: I’d hate to leave him in the dark!": 949,
"PYE: All available energy has been rerouted from the city to our experiment. Ramie and I are about to run a new test.": 950,
"RAMIE: Hypothesis confirmed! Hypothesis confirmed! I saw it! Pye saw it! <i>Hypothesis confirmed</i>!": 951,
"PYE: This is beyond extraordinary! This changes <i>everything</i>! What a beautiful day for the intersection of abstract theory and practical application!": 952,
"SECCA: Our <color=orange>escape pod</color> crashed as we tried to flee this place, destroying our movement and communication capabilities in the process.": 953,
"SECCA: We’ve held out as long as we could here, but this pod’s supply of breathable air is nearly depleted, and the anglerfish attack more and more frequently.": 954,
"SECCA: Our best chance at survival is to return to the <color=orange>Vessel</color> to either repair the damage or, more probably, await rescue.": 955,
"ESCALL: Secca, is the message finished? The <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s beacon is already growing fainter; it will be gone in a matter of hours. We need to leave here, quickly.": 956,
"CANNA: To any Nomai clans whose Vessels can hear this message:": 957,
"CANNA: It’s clear the universe is dying. There are fewer and fewer resources and safe places within space now, so my clan and I believe the best option is for all of our clans to stay together.": 958,
"CANNA: If you can reach the Gloaming Galaxy, we’ve found that Blackrock’s suns are fairly stable, and life in this star system is (comparatively) thriving. We live in relative safety.": 959,
"CANNA: If you prefer to continue exploring alone, know you will be on your own.": 960,
"BROMI: Canna, we’re making our way to you.": 961,
"CANNA: It’s good to hear from you, Bromi! We’ll watch for your Vessel.": 962,
"CANNA: Has anyone heard from Neem? His clan was on its way to our Vessel, but they never arrived, and he hasn’t sent any messages. I’m beginning to worry.": 963,
"BROMI: That <i>is</i> unsettling. It reminds me of that old myth my grandfather used to tell, the Disappearance of Escall.": 964,
"CLEM: I remember hearing that story as a child! One day, Escall’s <color=orange>Vessel</color> simply stopped responding. The other clans searched and searched, but found no trace. It was as if their missing friends had warped out of existence.": 965,
"HYSSOP: That’s no myth, friends; Escall’s clan existed, and their story was real.": 966,
"BROMI: What a curious event to have passed into myth! Our ancestors’ ancestors were told that story when they were young. Are you sure it’s true, Hyssop?": 967,
"HYSSOP: It was a very long time ago, but yes. My clan’s ancestors searched for Escall’s clan for a long time, but in the end, none of them were ever seen again. (It’s the only time in our history a Vessel has ever disappeared this way.)": 968,
"NEEM: Hyssop, I hope you aren’t comparing Escall’s story to my clan’s Vessel!": 969,
"CLEM: Neem, my friend! We feared you were gone!": 970,
"NEEM: Not yet, we aren’t, but nearly. We found trouble during our warp: The triple suns of the Bright Spark star system exploded, and it was only a lucky coincidence we weren’t caught in the blast. We’ll meet you soon, Canna!": 971,
"CANNA: I’m relieved your clan is safe, Neem! It’s good to hear your words. Any Vessels nearby, remember to be extremely cautious of potentially unstable stars (which is most of them, now).": 972,
"FILIX: This is Escall’s <color=orange>Vessel</color>; something went badly wrong during our warp, and our <color=orange>Vessel</color> is mortally wounded. We need help as quickly as possible!": 973,
"FILIX: Our <color=orange>Vessel</color> appears to have... has it <i>fused</i> with the local environment, somehow? There are vines that are now part of the <color=orange>Vessel</color>! It’s been torn apart from inside itself!": 974,
"FILIX: We... we are abandoning our <color=orange>Vessel</color>. Any Nomai clans or spaceflight-capable species receiving this message, I implore you, we need your help!": 975,
"FILIX: Is this broken? Can anyone hear me? Our <color=orange>Vessel</color> is dying! We need immediate assistance!": 976,
"FILIX: I’m recording now — I’ve never encountered anything like this! The signal the <color=orange>Vessel</color> is receiving appears to be <i>older than the universe itself</i>!": 977,
"ESCALL: This is our first contact with anything of this nature. Everyone, prepare to warp immediately!": 978,
"FILIX: Escall, wait, I need more time to send an outgoing message! Shouldn’t we tell another clan where we’re going?": 979,
"ESCALL: We can send the message upon our arrival. This extraordinary signal appeared suddenly; it may disappear just as quickly, and we can’t lose a discovery this incredible! Focus on preparing for the warp, instead.": 980,
"FILIX: I understand!": 981,
"ESCALL: Annona, is the <color=orange>Vessel</color> ready to warp to the signal’s approximate coordinates?": 982,
"ANNONA: The warp core is powered, but this will be a significant jump. Afterward, we’ll need time to recharge the core.": 983,
"ESCALL: That shouldn’t create a problem, provided we arrive at or near the signal’s source. Everyone, we’re ready to warp!": 984,
"CASSAVA: This is it: We’ve finished building the final <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> module and are ready to send it into orbit around <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color> for assembly!": 985,
"CASSAVA: To all my friends here at the <color=orange>Construction Yard</color>, my gratitude for your tireless work. I had given up hope, but I truly believe this cannon may actually succeed where many other attempts have not.": 986,
"DAZ: Are you going gelatinous on us, love? I’m delighted by your words, but they’re atypical for you!": 987,
"CASSAVA: If I’m ever half as gooey as Mallow and Avens behave together, Daz, you may launch <i>me</i> from the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color>.": 988,
"CASSAVA: Our next step will be to send Privet up to the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> to install the probe tracking system.": 989,
"DAZ: If I know my brother, Avens (and his spouse) will want to launch the probe with as much power as possible. I’m worried the cannon would break under the strain.": 990,
"DAZ: I propose we give Avens and Mallow a slightly lower maximum power setting than the absolute maximum possible to create room for their enthusiasm.": 991,
"Be welcomed in this place. This tower shares with all who ask the knowledge needed to make his or her first quantum journey.": 992,
"Enter this place without friends, however; these are lessons to learn for yourself.": 993,
"Seek the wandering arch.": 994,
"Observing a quantum object; observing an image of a quantum object. These are the same.": 995,
"This is the last one (but we made it harder).": 996,
"LAMI: They’re going to test the memory statues tonight! Phlox says it could be dangerous, so we can’t come.": 997,
"LAMI: <i>But</i>, what if we didn’t use the door and snuck in the <i>other</i> way? Does anyone want to?": 998,
"TAGET: Phlox <i>specifically</i> told us not to do that.": 999,
"LAEVI: I really want to see the test, too, Lami, but that’s a huge risk to take. We probably shouldn’t. Maybe Phlox’ll let us see a later test.": 1000,

"SOLANUM: I am here! After watching it wander the skies for so long, I am about to stand (for the first time) on the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>.": 1002,
"SOLANUM: As expected, my <color=orange>shuttle</color> has landed at the moon’s south pole. I will make the remainder of my journey on foot.": 1003,
"SOLANUM: We don’t know why the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color> always welcomes its visitors at the south pole, just that this is true.": 1004,
"SOLANUM: As a child, I considered such unknowns sinister. Now, though, I understand they bear no ill will. The universe is, and we are.": 1005,
"SOLANUM: I am ready.": 1006,

"PYE: Mission: Science compels us to explode the <color=lightblue>sun</color>!": 1008,
"IDAEA: Here’s a better one. Mission: Determine if it’s possible to prompt the <color=lightblue>sun</color> to explode.": 1009,
"IDAEA: Can’t we change this? I don’t enjoy working in view of such a morbid mission statement.": 1010,
"PYE: But it’s accurate. We’re going to create a supernova for the purpose of scientific progress. That’s our mission.": 1011,
"IDAEA: Our mission is to decide if such an irresponsible feat is even possible.": 1012,
"PYE: You lack a sense of humor.": 1013,
"IDAEA: At least I don’t lack a sense of ethics!": 1014,
"PYE: Kindly refrain from going supernova on me before the <color=lightblue>sun</color> does, Idaea.": 1015,
"THATCH: Where should this new, more sophisticated locator be built? It may need to be larger than this <color=orange>Eye signal locator</color> is.": 1016,
"PLUME: The southern glacier on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color> has ample available space. I could construct a new building to house this proposed locator.": 1017,
"FILIX: Yes, let’s build there! I imagine our young friend Conoy would enjoy that immensely. He’s always held a great interest in the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>, especially for a child born so long after the crash.": 1018,
"PLUME: I will begin construction on <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>’s south pole immediately, then!": 1019,
"COLEUS: Annona and those of us originally stranded on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color> built a <color=orange>Quantum Moon locator</color> there, but the heat of the <color=lightblue>sun</color> made its construction challenging. I wouldn’t recommend building on that planet.": 1020,
"COLEUS: After closer observation, mining site 2a wouldn’t be safe for the native life dwelling in some of this cave’s pools, so (unfortunately) we’ll have to mine one of the other sites.": 1021,
"COLEUS: On the opposite hand, new life! This species is semi-aquatic, and very hardy. The ecosystem here is quite robust, so I believe they’ll thrive in the long run. Be cautious near the pools if you visit 2a to meet them.": 1022,
"CYCAD: There are a few other cave sites that look promising. What about site 2b (it shares similar formations and strata)?": 1023,
"OENO: This sounds promising! Will you and your mentor investigate? If mining site 2b proves safe for this native species, we’ll move our work there.": 1024,
"CYCAD: Site 2b is safe! Coleus says we’ll continue to monitor our activity and its effect on life here.": 1025,
"CYCAD: I was watching them once during a rest, and the hours escaped from me. They’re fascinating (I wonder what their fourth eye does)!": 1026,
"COLEUS: They remind me of a subterranean species that my mentor, Melorae, once told me about (from when our clan used to travel across this universe). I imagine she would have enjoyed these lifeforms greatly.": 1027,
"CASSAVA: We’re nearly ready! Filix and I have finished construction, and she says calibrating the device won’t take long.": 1028,
"FILIX: Fortunately, the <color=lightblue>Attlerock</color>’s lack of atmosphere will make calibration simple. After all this time, I’m thrilled to finally resume our search!": 1029,
"Caution: You are about to access the core while the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> is active.": 1030,
"WARNING: Removing the core will disable the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>.": 1031,
"Artificial gravity control": 1032,
"YARROW: Today we finished the excavation of <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>. Here, in this space we carved, we will craft our most ambitious project yet: the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>, powerful enough to send information back in time.": 1033,
"COLEUS: We’ve also finished relocating all subterranean plants we met while digging.": 1034,
"RAMIE: We’ll need to keep our eyes on how significantly we’ve altered the environment here.": 1035,
"PYE: How far we’ve come since our experiments at the <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color>! I still can hardly believe Ramie’s hypothesis was true.": 1036,
"YARROW: Poke just sent the warp core for the final tower to us from the <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color>. Now <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color> can be connected with <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color>, where Cassava is working with Avens to craft the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color>, and where Phlox is sculpting the memory statues.": 1037,
"CASSAVA: Hypothesis: It was not by accident the core of our warp tower was the last to be forged.": 1038,
"POKE: Hypothesis: The cores could have been forged faster if Cassava had interrupted my work less frequently to ask for updates.": 1039,
"YARROW: The important point is we are all connected through <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color> now, and also that I’m no longer needed for mediating your disagreements.": 1040,
"YARROW: Our friends on <color=lightblue>Giant’s Deep</color> tested the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> today. Mallow tells me the cannon is doing well, and that Avens advocates for more launch power. If anyone can coax the maximum power from a device, Avens can.": 1041,
"YARROW: But then, if anyone can goad a device into exploding, that, too, is likely Avens. Perhaps I should check in with the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> crew in the interest of safety.": 1042,
"YARROW: Would it help to remind Avens that Mallow (his love) will be one of the Nomai aboard the cannon, or is Mallow part of the problem?": 1043,
"YARROW: Pye and Idaea have worked hard on the <color=orange>Sun Station</color>, and it at last is complete. If everything goes as planned, this structure will prompt the <color=lightblue>sun</color>’s explosion, which will in turn supply the power the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> requires.": 1044,
"RAMIE: I’m impressed by their mental fortitude. This was the project’s most difficult task, in more ways than one.": 1045,
"YARROW: We’re nearly ready to activate the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>! Here is what will happen: First, the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will receive the order to fire at the <color=lightblue>sun</color>, prompting it to explode.": 1046,
"YARROW: Using the energy from the resulting supernova, the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> will send the order for the <color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color> to fire back in time by 22 minutes.": 1047,
"YARROW: Exactly 22 minutes after these orders are received, the <color=orange>Sun Station</color> will again trigger the supernova to send the probe data from this cannon launch back in time.": 1048,
"YARROW: In total, each cycle created by the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> will last precisely 22 minutes. We can end this cycle at will.": 1049,
"YARROW: These words are difficult to write: The <color=orange>Sun Station</color> did not work.": 1050,
"YARROW: However, this is the closest we have ever been. The <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> is theoretically sound; we were only unable to power it. Perhaps there is another way.": 1051,
"PYE: Suppose we redesign the <color=orange>Sun Station</color>. To generate power of that magnitude, a supernova is still our only viable option.": 1052,
"IDAEA: This is easier expressed than accomplished.": 1053,
"PYE: You can wait for the <color=lightblue>sun</color> to explode on its natural timeline if you prefer, Idaea, but you’ll need to find some way to halt our aging process.": 1054,
"RAMIE: I believe we can still find a way to create a supernova, my friend. Don’t lose hope!": 1055,
"YARROW: We are halting our research into creating a supernova for this moment; a <color=lightblue>comet</color> has newly arrived in this solar system, and we’re anxious to explore it.": 1056,
"YARROW: It’s been a very long time since we last explored somewhere new, so we’re excited to welcome this <color=lightblue>comet</color>. Imagine what knowledge might be gained there!": 1057,
"PYE: Friends visiting from the <color=orange>Hanging City</color>, we are planning the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color> at the <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color> on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>’s equator.": 1058,
"CONOY: I became lost on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color> (my gratitude that Ramie found me!), but the <color=orange>High Energy Lab</color> is the building with the large solar panels. I’m suprised I didn’t see it!": 1059,
"RAMIE: I imagine our otherwise immensely clever Conoy would lose his own head if it weren’t anatomically impossible!": 1060,
"The <color=orange>shuttle</color> is currently resting at the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>.": 1061,
"What is the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>?": 1062,
"The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is the source of the signal that brought us here.": 1063,
"Suppose the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is a more advanced being.": 1064,
"The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is older than this universe, so imagine how much it could teach us.": 1065,
"Perhaps it is a cosmic library!": 1066,
"What is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal?": 1067,
"Suppose the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> wishes to communicate.": 1068,
"The signal is a call. Were we the intended audience?": 1069,
"The signal is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s voice. It speaks a language we don’t yet know.": 1070,
"Or maybe the signal is the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s attempt at expressing itself.": 1071,
"Of note: From the signal, we were able to determine the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s approximate age (or perhaps its lack of age?).": 1072,
"Be welcomed in this place. This shrine is a space to reflect on what brought us to this star system: the signal from the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>.": 1073,
"We observed the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal in our travels, and followed it here to find its source.": 1074,
"What we know is this: The source of the signal (which we have chosen to call the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>) is older than this universe itself. The rest, we have yet to learn.": 1075,
"Enter, and open your mind to its possibilities.": 1076,
"Solution 1: We could retrieve the warp core from the <color=orange>Vessel</color>.": 1077,
"RAMIE: The <color=orange>Vessel</color>’s warp core is broken, at best (recall those present when the <color=orange>Vessel</color> crashed said it sustained lethal injuries). There is no guaranteed reward for this risk.": 1078,
"CONOY: Perhaps we could still repair it. My grandmother told me there was little time to assess the nature or extent of the damage.": 1079,
"CASSAVA: Even if it no longer functions, the old core could be a valuable blueprint, provided we’re able to transport it back here.": 1080,
"PHLOX: This would require a return to <color=lightblue>Dark Bramble</color>. Plume (my father) said many good Nomai perished there.": 1081,
"CYCAD: My mentor (Coleus) and his old mentor once discovered and studied an anglerfish fossil on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>. Using that knowledge, we could avoid the anglerfish entirely!": 1082,
"COLEUS: What Melorae and I learned from that fossil would theoretically help us evade the anglerfish, but our hypothesis was never tested on a live specimen.": 1083,
"RAMIE: I remember that anglerfish fossil! We used to play in <color=orange>Fossil Fish Cave</color> when we were children.": 1084,
"SOLANUM: I no longer believe, as I did as a child on <color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>, that the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color> (the source of the signal) wishes to harm us. But it may not want to be found, either.": 1085,
"SOLANUM: The terrible circumstances of our arrival here were almost certainly exactly that: circumstance.": 1086,
"SOLANUM: I suspect imagining we are special to the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> in some way is wishful thinking. The <color=lightblue>Eye</color> might have called out to any sentient species.": 1087,
"SOLANUM: Or it might not have been calling out at all, and that my ancestors heard the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>’s signal holds no great, deep meaning.": 1088,
"SOLANUM: This wouldn’t be so bad, I think.": 1089,
"SOLANUM: In fact, the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> may not have wishes at all. We have no evidence supporting this.": 1090,
"ILEX: Why We Should Build A New Vessel": 1091,
"ILEX: Each Nomai clan explores the universe in its own Vessel. The Vessel is the heart of every clan.": 1092,
"ILEX: It’s unusual for Nomai to remain in one place for so long. Nomai are wanderers and have no permanent home.": 1093,
"ILEX: If we built a new Vessel, we could return to our adventurous way of life. Imagine all the new places we could go! Our clan wouldn’t be stuck here in this star system.": 1094,
"ILEX: We could even meet with other Nomai, and learn from them, like Coleus says we used to do.": 1095,
"ILEX: It probably wouldn’t be hard to get parts if we stopped building other new things, and if we broke down other structures (like the towers on <color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>) for parts.": 1096,
"ILEX: We might have to build a smaller Vessel for now, even though Vessels are normally large. But we could make it bigger later once we reach planets with more resources.": 1097,
"ILEX: It would also help if we stopped building so many things to search for the <color=lightblue>Eye of the universe</color>. I asked Yarrow, and he says we use lots of resources on the <color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>.": 1098,
"ILEX: We could even have a warp core for jumping long distances like Vessels have. Poke tells me she plans to make a very advanced warp core for a different project. I’m sure she could connect it to the Vessel for travel (because Poke is smart).": 1099,
"THATCH: Is everyone unharmed?": 1100,
"PLUME: No one was badly injured from the <color=orange>escape pod’s</color> impact. We’re incredibly fortunate.": 1101,
"THATCH: This is good news, at least. Have we heard from <color=orange>Escape Pod 2</color> or <color=orange>Escape Pod 3</color>?": 1102,
"FILIX: No, I... I’m unable to make contact. My equipment can hear the other two escape pods’ distress signals, however. If it’s any comfort, both pods must be structurally intact.": 1103,
"FILIX: I’ll continue calling for them.": 1104,
"THATCH: My gratitude. If we can —": 1105,
"PLUME: Thatch, the moon is approaching again!": 1106,

"MALLOW: Based on our knowledge of the <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>, we believe the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is in orbit around this star system’s <color=lightblue>sun</color>. This would mean the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is located within a finite (albeit enormous) range.": 1120,

"CASSAVA: Mallow’s idea is clever, but we have no idea where the <color=lightblue>Eye</color> is in relation to here. The probability of launching a probe in the correct direction would be absurdly small.": 1124,
"CONOY: I believe I have a solution for that problem! Have you spoken with Ramie and Pye about the technology they’re developing?": 1125,

"RiebecksJournalGravity crystals produce a local gravity distortion that affects the area around them, up to a certain radius. They’re very clever! Nomai used them to anchor themselves to surfaces they might want to traverse down.": 1509,

"Tektite5Hmph. This is going to be a chore to chop up, and no mistake. Can we even remove a seed that doesn’t have the decency to stay the same size all the way through?": 1606,
"Tektite5Maybe I’d better grab an extra axe or three, just in case.": 1607,
"Tektite6Inside the seed? Huh. Dunno what to tell you there - the only harmonica player I know is Feldspar, and they disappeared ages ago.": 1608,

"RiebeckRiebeckLearnedI TALKED TO A LIVING NOMAI!": 1790,
"RiebeckRiebeckLearnedActually, nevermind.": 1791,
"RiebeckLearned_ExitOh, okay. If you do learn something new about the Nomai, though, I’d love to hear it! Um, if you don’t mind, I mean.": 1792,
"RiebeckLearned_1Wow! So then, the Nomai probably came here from somewhere outside the solar system. And they must have been in trouble when they launched their escape pod... but what kind of trouble?": 1793,
"RiebeckLearned_1And where did the escape pod launch from? I’m so curious!": 1794,
"RiebeckLearned_1This is an amazing discovery. I hope we can find out more about how and why the Nomai arrived here!": 1795,
"RiebeckLearned_2You did?! That, that’s incredible, congratulations!": 1796,
"RiebeckLearned_2That means they really <i>were</i> from far outside our solar system. Haha, <i>yes</i>! I knew it!": 1797,
"RiebeckLearned_2But that creates so many new questions! If they didn’t come from our solar system, where did they come from? Are they from our galaxy, or somewhere even farther? What were their lives like before they came here? And <i>why</i> did they come here?": 1798,
"RiebeckLearned_2Hey, I... I might not be much of an astronaut, but I’m really glad I came out here to see the Nomai’s artifacts for myself. And, um, thanks for telling me. <Pause/>About the Vessel, I mean.": 1799,
"RiebeckLearned_3Isn’t it amazing? Hard to believe the settlement is still standing, but there it is.": 1800,
"RiebeckLearned_3It really makes you appreciate living somewhere like Timber Hearth. You know, somewhere that isn’t being constantly bombarded with meteors and rocks and stuff.": 1801,
"RiebeckLearned_4You visited the Hanging City? Oh gosh, how was it? Was it amazing? Was it beautiful? ...Was it scary?": 1802,
"RiebeckLearned_4The Hanging City is where the Nomai settled permanently on Brittle Hollow. It was their most advanced settlement here!": 1803,
"RiebeckLearned_4Why they chose to build their most advanced settlement so close to a <i>you-know-what</i> is beyond me. Maybe that kind of thing makes sense to a Nomai, though. ...Maybe they needed the <size=20>black hole</size> for something?": 1804,
"RiebeckLearned_5You mean there’s another Nomai city <i>inside</i> of Ember Twin? That’s incredible! A whole city, and I had no idea it existed! This is great!": 1805,
"RiebeckLearned_5How did they keep the sand out? If it were me, I’d be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand. Gosh, the Nomai sure were ingenius, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City! ...Wow!": 1806,
"RiebeckLearned_5That means there were two groups of Nomai — one that lived on Ember Twin, and one that lived here on Brittle Hollow. But they must have traveled around the solar system, since Nomai writing can be found on other planets, too.": 1807,
"RiebeckLearned_6A pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon? The Nomai mentioned the Quantum Moon in a lot of their writing, so it was clearly special to them. And um, special enough to make a trip there by themselves!": 1808,
"RiebeckLearned_6It sounds like a coming-of-age ritual, like how hatchlings stay hatchlings until their stomachs are strong enough to drink sap wine.": 1809,
"RiebeckLearned_6Maybe once a Nomai journeyed to the Quantum Moon, they were considered an adult?": 1810,
"RiebeckLearned_7Oh, wow. <i>Wow.</i> So that’s how the Nomai died?": 1811,
"RiebeckLearned_7That’s... really sad, isn’t it? I know it was a long time ago, but still...": 1812,
"RiebeckLearned_7Stars above, it’s lucky we hadn’t evolved to live on land yet.": 1813,
"RiebeckLearned_7To think, if the comet hadn’t killed them, our species might have coexisted in this solar system. That would have been amazing.": 1814,
"RiebeckLearned_7But...": 1815,
"RiebeckLearned_7I guess if I hadn’t wanted to learn why the Nomai disappeared, I’d never have left Timber Hearth and come out here, or had any of these adventures.": 1816,
"RiebeckLearned_7...Don’t get me wrong, space is terrifying! But, you know, it has its moments.": 1817,
"RiebeckLearned_8AHHH! That doesn’t make any sense! I don’t understand! I am very excited for you, though! P-please stop yelling!": 1818,
"RiebeckLearned_8...What? On the Quantum Moon, you said?<Pause> There’s a sort of-living Nomai on the Quantum Moon?!": 1819,
"RiebeckLearned_8WELL, WHY DIDN’T YOU SAY SO?!": 1820,
"RiebeckLearned_8Oh wow! <i>Wow</i>! This is the best thing that’s ever happened in the history of Outer Wilds Ventures! I can’t believe you talked to an actual Nomai!": 1821,
"RiebeckLearned_8Great! So I just have to go back into space, fly to the Quantum Moon with zero visibility, find a spooky ruin, and travel through a few different types of dangerous terrain to get there.": 1822,
"RiebeckLearned_8Okay, yeah, that’s... that’s not so bad. <Pause><size=20>That’s probably doable...</size>": 1823,
"SignThis piece of Nomai writing was essential to deciphering their unique language.": 1824,

"ROOT: I was hoping to deliver new ore data to Poke in her <color=orange>Black Hole Forge</color>, but the warp tower on the <color=orange>Twilight Twin</color> sent me to the wrong part of <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>.": 1843,
"ROOT: Could someone kindly remind me if there’s a way to warp directly to the forge or if I imagined this?": 1844,
"CLARY: There is! The <color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color> warp tower that stands on the <color=orange>Twilight Twin</color> will take you to two different places, including the forge. Just make sure you start at the correct place within the tower.": 1845,

"SOLANUM: The <color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color> probably exhibits macroscopic quantum behavior because of its proximity to the <color=lightblue>Eye</color>.

"Curator2We’ve barely scratched the surface of the Nomai writing in our solar system, so we still know very little about them. We’ve no idea if they originated here or traveled here, or why they disappeared.": 2298,
"Curator2That tool of yours should prove indispensible in solving the mystery of this ancient species!": 2299,
"Curator3You’re going to check in with them, are you? Not a bad plan - no one knows the solar system better than our astronauts.": 2300,
"Curator3Let’s see... Chert is on the Hourglass Twins, Riebeck is on Brittle Hollow, and Gabbro is on Giant’s Deep, last I checked.": 2301,

"Curator3Feldspar has been lost for a very long time, I’m afraid.": 2303,
"Curator3...On a more cheerful note, you’ll find Esker stationed on the Attlerock. They’re not a traveler so much as a lunar local, but I’m sure they’d appreciate a visit nevertheless.": 2304,
"Curator4I like it! You’ll have plenty of options to choose from.": 2305,
"Curator4No one’s ever landed on the Interloper before, you know. Perhaps you’ll be the first?": 2306,
"Curator4I must say... Should you choose to go to Dark Bramble, be <i>very</i> careful. No one’s explored there before, either, for what you’ll find are excellent reasons.": 2307,
"Curator5You’d prefer to ease into things? That’s a sensible plan! More sensible than most of our astronauts tend to be, and that’s a fact.": 2308,
"Curator5Do you think you’ll go to the Attlerock, then? Our moon would be a safe place to travel to and get your bearings in space, and I’m sure Esker would appreciate the visit.": 2309,
"Curator5Plus, we don’t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!": 2310,
"Curator6Haha! Overwhelmed by the options, perhaps? I don’t blame you.": 2311,
"Curator6If you need help getting started, you could go visit Esker on the moon. They’re alone on the Attlerock most of the time, so I’m sure they’d appreciate it.": 2312,

"Curator7Planning to follow in the footsteps of Feldspar and the great Outer Wilds Ventures tradition, are you? I might have guessed.": 2314,
"Curator7Well, see if you can’t put that translator tool of yours to good use while you’re out there!": 2315,
"Curator8Well then, looks like all that’s left is to send you off! All in all, it’s a fine day for a launch!": 2316,
