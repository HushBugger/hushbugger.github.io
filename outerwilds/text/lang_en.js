"Gabbro"

"Do you think the statues are recording our memories, then? \u2019Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!",

"Right, right, the cavern inside Statue Island is where the memory-recording statues were made, I remember.",
"Gabbro"

"Gabbro"
],
"436": [
"This is all pretty wild.",
"Gabbro"
],
"437": [
"You\u2019re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we\u2019ve gone through.",
"Gabbro"
],
"438": [
"Wait, then it\u2019s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?",
"Gabbro"
],
"439": [
"That\u2019s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven\u2019t, because technically the loops never happened.",
"Gabbro"
],
"440": [
"Meaning we\u2019re receiving memories of things that will never happen to us. Cool, huh?",
"Gabbro"
],
"441": [
"Right, you told me earlier that the point of the statues is to send memories back in time. Which I guess makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we\u2019ve gone through.",
"Gabbro"
],
"442": [
"I thought about it some more, and I think that means our minds have gone through all these loops, but we haven\u2019t actually gone through them ourselves.",
"Gabbro"

"Meaning we\u2019re receiving memories of things that technically will never happen to us. Cool, huh?",
"Gabbro"

"Gabbro"
],
"449": [
"Come to think of it, though, \u201cbroke\u201d might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop.",
"Gabbro"
],
"450": [
"So the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I\u2019m seeing fall from the sky every loop.",
"Gabbro"
],
"451": [
"I\u2019m still surprised the Nomai built something that isn\u2019t holding together, you know? Them being genius crafters and all.",
"Gabbro"
],
"452": [
"On the other hand, maybe we should be impressed they made something that could last until modern day in the first place. And it looks like the cannon is still firing successfully at the start of each time loop.",
"Gabbro"

"453": [
"Yeah, the one in the woods, I remember writing that. Pretty fun, right? It works out to a good 24 poems.",
"Gabbro"

"Gabbro"

"457": [
"Must have been from the time Hornfels sent me to check on the deep space satellite. They thought Ol\u2019 Spacey might be malfunctioning, but I couldn\u2019t find a single thing wrong with it.",
"Gabbro"

"458": [
"Which is probably how it got a shot of my beautiful be-helmeted face, come to think of it.",
"Gabbro"
],
"459": [
"I always thought it was kinda sweet that the best way to find Ol\u2019 Spacey is to use a map that\u2019s generated by the satellite itself, isn\u2019t it? Like it\u2019s inviting us to visit. Good ol\u2019 deep space satellite, always making sure we know where we\u2019re going.",

"Gabbro"
],
"464": [
"Best guess says the deep space satellite must have sent Timber Hearth some weird pictures, but like\u2026 what\u2019s considered \u201cweird\u201d for a satellite, you know?",
"Gabbro"

"465": [
"Anyway, if you ever want to visit Ol\u2019 Spacey, fastest way is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to the satellite, same as you would any astral body.",
"Gabbro"
],
"466": [
"I mean, the satellite\u2019s not <em>super</em> old, but it\u2019s hardly brand-new. \u201cOl\u2019\u201d is more a term of affection. ...You\u2019re being very literal-minded about this.",
"Gabbro"

"467": [
"Ol\u2019 Spacey likes visitors, you know! Fastest way to find it is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to our faithful satellite friend, same as you would any astral body.",

"In case you were hit especially hard, don\u2019t forget that you can jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to any astral body. It\u2019s the easiest way to visit Ol\u2019 Spacey, too.",

"Gabbro",
"Me"

"Me"

"2233": [
"And another thing - we died, but we aren\u2019t dead? That\u2019s pretty unusual for Hearthians.",
