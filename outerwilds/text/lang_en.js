],
"377": [

],
"380": [
"Gabbro",

],
"399": [
"Gabbro",
"Here\u2019s something you might like \u2014 at the start of every time loop, I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet."
],
"400": [

"What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been calling it, seeing as it\u2019s the <em>island</em> where I found the glowing Nomai <em>statue</em>. ...Get it?"
],
"401": [
"Gabbro",
"I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It\u2019s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale."
],
"402": [
"Gabbro",
"If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it\u2019s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You\u2019ll see."

"Gabbro",
"Haha, I know, right?"
],
"404": [

"...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant\u2019s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there."
],
"405": [

"There\u2019s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked."

"Gabbro",
"You\u2019ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they\u2019re hard to miss. They\u2019ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip \u2014 if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you."
],
"408": [
"Gabbro",
"That\u2019s a good question."
],
"409": [
"Gabbro",
"It\u2019s definitely on this planet <em>some</em>where. I mean, unless a cyclone came by and tossed it into space, I guess. Heh, that would be pretty nuts."

"Nice, nice. Whatcha got for me?"
],

"Gabbro/Me",
"I reached the inside of Statue Island."
],
"419": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"I found the source of the time loop."
],
"420": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"I found Nomai masks inside the Ash Twin Project."
],
"421": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"I found what happened to the Orbital Probe Cannon."
],
"422": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"I found your quantum poem."
],
"423": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"I found a photo of you inside the old radio tower."
],
"424": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"Actually, nevermind."
],
"425": [
"Gabbro",
"So the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing."
],
"426": [
"Gabbro",
"Do you think the statues are recording our memories, then? \u2019Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!"
],
"427": [
"Gabbro",
"Right, right, the cavern inside Statue Island is where the memory-recording statues were made, I remember."
],
"428": [
"Gabbro",
"So your memory statue is the one in the museum back in the crater, and mine\u2019s the one I found on the beach. I kinda dig having my own personal memory-friend."
],
"429": [
"Gabbro",
"If you come up with any hunches about what the Nomai wanted to record memories for, feel free to run them by me! You know where I\u2019ll be."
],
"430": [
"Gabbro",
"Wait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out the Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is <em>wild</em>."
],
"431": [
"Gabbro",
"Now we know what\u2019s causing the loop, then. And... if it\u2019s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh..."
],
"432": [
"Gabbro",
"Hey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there\u2019s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn\u2019t, what with the sun blowing up and all."
],
"433": [
"Gabbro",
"Then again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?"
],
"434": [
"Gabbro",
"...I dunno, I\u2019m no time loop expert. I\u2019m just gonna sit here and ponder the intricacies of time and space. Maybe take a nap, too, if I feel like it."
],
"435": [
"Gabbro",
"My head\u2019s still all full of scenarios for what would happen if you turned off the time loop. I\u2019ll probably notice if you decide to mess with it, though, right? Seems like something I\u2019d notice."
],
"436": [
"Gabbro",
"This is all pretty wild."
],
"437": [
"Gabbro",
"You\u2019re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we\u2019ve gone through."
],
"438": [
"Gabbro",
"Wait, then it\u2019s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?"
],
"439": [
"Gabbro",
"That\u2019s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven\u2019t, because technically the loops never happened."
],
"440": [
"Gabbro",
"Meaning we\u2019re receiving memories of things that will never happen to us. Cool, huh?"
],
"441": [
"Gabbro",
"Right, you told me earlier that the point of the statues is to send memories back in time. Which I guess makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we\u2019ve gone through."
],
"442": [
"Gabbro",
"I thought about it some more, and I think that means our minds have gone through all these loops, but we haven\u2019t actually gone through them ourselves."
],
"443": [
"Gabbro",
"Meaning we\u2019re receiving memories of things that technically will never happen to us. Cool, huh?"
],
"444": [
"Gabbro",
"Whoa, that\u2019s the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop? For real?"
],
"445": [
"Gabbro",
"Did you figure out why?"
],
"446": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"Too much power."
],
"447": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"Overenthusiasm."
],
"448": [
"Gabbro",
"...It\u2019s kind of scary how much that sounds like something Slate or Feldspar would do. I\u2019m pretty surprised the Nomai built something that actually broke!"
],
"449": [
"Gabbro",
"Come to think of it, though, \u201cbroke\u201d might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop."
],
"450": [
"Gabbro",
"So the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I\u2019m seeing fall from the sky every loop."
],
"451": [
"Gabbro",
"I\u2019m still surprised the Nomai built something that isn\u2019t holding together, you know? Them being genius crafters and all."
],
"452": [
"Gabbro",
"On the other hand, maybe we should be impressed they made something that could last until modern day in the first place. And it looks like the cannon is still firing successfully at the start of each time loop."
],
"453": [
"Gabbro",
"Yeah, the one in the woods, I remember writing that. Pretty fun, right? It works out to a good 24 poems."
],
"454": [
"Gabbro",
"When I\u2019m done exploring, I want to make some more quantum art. Maybe some kind of creature sculpture that just, like, shows up and scares the daylights out of you."
],
"455": [
"Gabbro",
"Yeah, you mentioned that before. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy."
],
"456": [
"Gabbro",
"Nice. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy."
],
"457": [
"Gabbro",
"Must have been from the time Hornfels sent me to check on the deep space satellite. They thought Ol\u2019 Spacey might be malfunctioning, but I couldn\u2019t find a single thing wrong with it."
],
"458": [
"Gabbro",
"Which is probably how it got a shot of my beautiful be-helmeted face, come to think of it."
],
"459": [
"Gabbro",
"I always thought it was kinda sweet that the best way to find Ol\u2019 Spacey is to use a map that\u2019s generated by the satellite itself, isn\u2019t it? Like it\u2019s inviting us to visit. Good ol\u2019 deep space satellite, always making sure we know where we\u2019re going."
],
"460": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"Why\u2019d Hornfels think it was broken?"
],
"461": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"Um. \u201cOl\u2019 Spacey\u201d?"
],
"462": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"I have a map?!"
],
"463": [
"Gabbro",
"Dunno. Hornfels probably told me why, but Hornfels tells me lots of things, and sometimes I tune out. Or pretend there\u2019s signal interference and I can\u2019t hear them."
],
"464": [
"Gabbro",
"Best guess says the deep space satellite must have sent Timber Hearth some weird pictures, but like\u2026 what\u2019s considered \u201cweird\u201d for a satellite, you know?"
],
"465": [
"Gabbro",
"Anyway, if you ever want to visit Ol\u2019 Spacey, fastest way is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to the satellite, same as you would any astral body."
],
"466": [
"Gabbro",
"I mean, the satellite\u2019s not <em>super</em> old, but it\u2019s hardly brand-new. \u201cOl\u2019\u201d is more a term of affection. ...You\u2019re being very literal-minded about this."
],
"467": [
"Gabbro",
"Ol\u2019 Spacey likes visitors, you know! Fastest way to find it is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to our faithful satellite friend, same as you would any astral body."
],
"468": [
"Gabbro",
"Yeah, um, the one that\u2019s standard with all our spacesuits? The one you have with you at all times that opens with the press of a button? \u2026That map?"
],
"469": [
"Gabbro",
"You didn\u2019t get conked on the head by a rock or a meteorite or something on your way here, did you? No shame in that. Happens to me all the time!"
],
"470": [
"Gabbro",
"In case you were hit especially hard, don\u2019t forget that you can jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to any astral body. It\u2019s the easiest way to visit Ol\u2019 Spacey, too."
],
"471": [
"Gabbro",
"No worries. Feel free to let me know when you do find something cool, though. You know where to find me."
],
"472": [
"Gabbro",
"I was hoping you\u2019d be back - something <em>really</em> weird is going on."
],
"473": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"Do you think we\u2019re in a time loop?"
],
"474": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"We\u2019re definitely in a time loop."
],
"475": [
"Gabbro",
"Yeah, a time loop makes the most sense, right? Or at least, it\u2019s some kind of fidgety time business. Hard to say what\u2019s happening to the shape of time, exactly, but let\u2019s go with \u201cloop\u201d for now."
],
"476": [
"Gabbro",
"Oh. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool."
],
"477": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"You\u2019re taking this pretty well."
],
"478": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"What did you think it was?"
],
"479": [
"Gabbro",
"Heh, right back at you. Personally, I like new experiences, and I\u2019ve never been in a time loop before."
],
"480": [
"Gabbro",
"Well. I don\u2019t <em>think</em> I\u2019ve been in a time loop before this one, but then, it\u2019s not like I can know that for sure."
],
"481": [
"Gabbro",
"I figured it\u2019d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn\u2019t really thinking about what\u2019s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let\u2019s go with \u201cloop\u201d for now."
],
"482": [
"Gabbro",
"So it looks like you and I are the only ones who know we\u2019re in a time loop. And even if you tell them about it, no one remembers by the next loop. What\u2019s with that?"
],
"483": [
"Gabbro",
"Maybe it\u2019s because we both made some seriously intense eye contact with a Nomai statue?"
],
"484": [
"Gabbro",
"I\u2019m seeing my memories replay each time I die, just like I did when the Nomai statue on the beach opened its eyes and looked at me. So maybe... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?"
],
"485": [
"Gabbro",
"I think that\u2019s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I\u2019ll be here."

"487": [

"What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been calling it, seeing as it\u2019s the <em>island</em> where I found the glowing Nomai <em>statue</em>. ...Get it?"
],
"543": [

"Haha, I know, right?"

"As for land masses, I\u2019ve counted four islands, including this one. There\u2019s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach."
],

"Gabbro",
"You\u2019ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they\u2019re hard to miss. They\u2019ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip \u2014 if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you."
],
"550": [

"So the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing."
],
"551": [
"Gabbro",
"Do you think the statues are recording our memories, then? \u2019Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!"

"Wait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is <em>wild</em>."
],
"553": [
"Gabbro",
"Now we know what\u2019s causing the loop, then. And... if it\u2019s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh..."
],
"554": [
"Gabbro",
"Hey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there\u2019s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn\u2019t, what with the sun blowing up and all."
],
"555": [
"Gabbro",
"Then again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?"
],
"556": [

],
"712": [
"Feldspar",

"713": [
"Feldspar",
"But after a while, I run into this huge anglerfish \u2014 you\u2019ve seen \u2019em? Big gnarly things, and this was the biggest one I\u2019ve ever seen. I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off \u2014 nothing too fancy. I\u2019m going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and..."
],

"Oh, this is a good story. I\u2019d just finished exploring the core of Giant\u2019s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever been inside Dark Bramble, so I think, hey, let\u2019s give that a try."

"718": [
"Feldspar",
"I came to Dark Bramble for the excitement. I\u2019d just finished exploring the core of Giant\u2019s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever gone farther than Dark Bramble\u2019s ice fields, so I thought, hey, let\u2019s give it a try."

],
"723": [
"Feldspar",
"These days, I\u2019m used to it."
],
"724": [

"Heh, you got it in one. Kind of hard not to, once you\u2019ve seen one of those fish up close and personal-like."
],
"730": [

"Well, take a load off and refill your oxygen tank, hatchling! There\u2019s plenty of fire to go around."

],
"748": [
"Feldspar",
"Oh, the skeleton? It was like this when I got here."
],
"749": [
"Feldspar",
"As near as I can tell, this anglerfish must have been chewing on the vine and eaten a seed, and then the seed grew and grew in the poor fish\u2019s stomach until... this happened."
],
"750": [
"Feldspar",
"Gross, huh?"
],
"751": [
"Feldspar",
"This skeleton was a good find. Keeps the fish away. See, they\u2019re territorial, so they mostly avoid each other. That\u2019s why I set up camp here."
],
"752": [
"Feldspar",
"Giant\u2019s Deep\u2019s core, huh? Ahhh, that was a wild one."
],
"753": [
"Feldspar",
"But since you\u2019re asking, I gotta assume you haven\u2019t made it down there yourself yet, right? If I tell you how, it kinda feels like cheating."
],
"754": [
"Feldspar",
"Hm..."
],
"755": [
"Feldspar",
"...On a <em>completely unrelated</em> note, that sure was a big, hollow vine my ship crashed into. Yep."
],
"756": [
"Feldspar",
"If I were you, I\u2019d go take a walk and see where it ends."
],
"757": [
"Feldspar",
"You\u2019ll want to go to the tail end of this anglerfish skeleton here and look for a flickering light in the fog \u2014 that\u2019ll be my old ship. Path starts there."
],
"758": [
"Feldspar",
"If you change your mind, you know where to find me!"
],
"759": [
"Feldspar",
"Well... yeah, sure, whenever you have the time."
],
"760": [
"Feldspar",
"Frankly, I kinda like it out here. Quiet, peaceful...ish."
],
"761": [
"Feldspar",
"You\u2019re a little young to understand, but it\u2019s a lot of pressure, being the best that ever was. Been nice to have a break."
],
"762": [
"Feldspar",
"That\u2019s the spirit!"
],
"763": [
"Feldspar",
"Anywhere\u2019s good, but you should know that space is weird here. Intensely."
],
"764": [
"Feldspar",
"Ever tried throwing your scout into one of these weird seeds? See there, with the little opening? It\u2019s just big enough to launch one through."
],
"765": [
"Feldspar",
"Your scout tracker will tell you the scout is in two places at once, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s... wrong, exactly, because space doesn\u2019t work right in here. That seed looks small, see? But inside, it\u2019s bigger."
],
"766": [
"Feldspar",
"<em>Much</em> bigger."
],
"767": [
"Feldspar",
"I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about this, and my theory is space in Dark Bramble kind of expands as you go through each sphere. That\u2019s why it\u2019s bigger inside those seeds."
],
"768": [
"Feldspar",
"Well, that\u2019s my theory. Keep that in mind while you\u2019re exploring Dark Bramble and maybe you won\u2019t get lost inside forever."
],
"769": [
"Feldspar",
"Good luck!"
],
"770": [
"Feldspar",
"Not far from here, as a matter of fact! If you go straight past the tail of this anglerfish skeleton here, you\u2019ll see a flickering light in the fog."
],
"771": [
"Feldspar",
"Follow that, and you\u2019ll find my old ship. What\u2019s left of it, anyway."
],
"772": [
"Feldspar",
"Lay it on me, hatchling!"
],
"773": [
"Feldspar/Me",
"I went to the core of Giant\u2019s Deep."
],
"774": [
"Feldspar/Me",
"I found the frozen jellyfish near your ship."
],
"775": [
"Feldspar/Me",
"I found the Anglerfish nest."
],
"776": [
"Feldspar/Me",
"I found a Dark Bramble seed on Timber Hearth."

"I found a Nomai shuttle and flew it!"
],
"779": [
"Feldspar/Me",
"Actually, nevermind."
],
"780": [
"Feldspar",
"So you figured out the ol\u2019 tornado trick, did you? Good work!"
],
"781": [
"Feldspar",
"I found that bit out by accident, but let\u2019s keep that between you and me, hey? Hornfels would have my very handsome head if they knew I\u2019d been riding the cyclones again."
],
"782": [
"Feldspar",
"\"The ship is fragile! It can break! You can\u2019t subject it to extreme conditions!\" Not like I was flying the thing into the sun, now, was I?"
],
"783": [
"Feldspar",
"And the jellyfish, you figured those out, too? Hatchling, I tell you what, you\u2019ve done real well for yourself! You\u2019re a fine astronaut, sure, but you might just become a pilot yet!"
],
"784": [
"Feldspar",
"Ha! So the old thing still there, is it? That\u2019s where I first camped out after the crash, you know. It was pretty cozy inside!"
],
"785": [
"Feldspar",
"It does lack the structural integrity and indomitable spirit of a camp made in the shelter of the very bones of the species that tried to eat you, I suppose."
],
"786": [
"Feldspar",
"Still. Very cozy."
],
"787": [
"Feldspar",
"So that\u2019s where the blasted things come from, is it? Stars above, if I still had a working ship, I\u2019d be sorely tempted to go show \u2019em what\u2019s what!"
],
"788": [
"Feldspar",
"<span class=\"grey\">Sigh...</span>"
],
"789": [
"Feldspar",
"Probably best to leave \u2019em alone, though, really. More trouble than it\u2019s worth to mess with anglerfish."
],
"790": [
"Feldspar",
"...That\u2019s bad business, hatchling."
],
"791": [
"Feldspar",
"As Chert will tell you if you so much as glance in Dark Bramble\u2019s direction, there used to be a fifth planet where the Bramble is now."
],
"792": [
"Feldspar",
"This infernal plant appeared at the center and kept growing, and growing, and growing, until it shattered the planet and scattered its pieces across space."
],
"793": [
"Feldspar",
"If we don\u2019t get that seed you found sorted real quicklike, I suspect Timber Hearth will be heading toward the same fate. And I tell you what, we Hearthians have overcome far too much to be done in by some worthless <em>seed</em>."
],
"794": [
"Feldspar",
"A-<em>ha</em>! So the blasted things <em>do</em> have a weakness!"
],
"795": [
"Feldspar",
"Meaning my fly-as-fast-as-I-can approach to dealing with them could have used a bit more thought behind it."
],
"796": [
"Feldspar",
"Ah, well, at least they didn\u2019t eat me. All\u2019s well that ends well, eh, hatchling?"
],
"797": [
"Feldspar",
"You flew a Nomaian shuttle? You don\u2019t say! How was it? How did it handle?"
],
"798": [
"Feldspar",
"Can\u2019t say I\u2019d mind having a go at that myself, hatchling. Once I return to Timber Hearth, maybe that\u2019ll have to be my next stop."
],

"But hey, when you <em>are</em> ready, then you can make the most of our translator tool! <span class=\"grey\">Sniff...</span> I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s all grown up and leaving for space already."
],
"1431": [

"For real, though, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re the one carrying it and not, like, Riebeck. They\u2019d fall on it for sure."
],
"1432": [
"Hal",
"Say, if you want to do a short trip to just get your space legs under you, you could check out the ruins on the Attlerock! I\u2019d love to learn what those are."

"Hal",
"I mean, if you\u2019re saying it happened, then... I guess maybe it did. But why?"
],

],
"1435": [
"Hal",
"I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get any answers from the museum statue, but Gabbro said they were going back to Giant\u2019s Deep. Dunno which island they\u2019re on, though."
],
"1436": [
"Hal",
"Maybe they\u2019d be able to tell you more? On the other hand, Gabbro\u2019s, y\u2019know, <em>Gabbro</em>, so maybe you\u2019d be better off searching for more info on your own."

"From Giant\u2019s Deep! Gabbro fished it out of the oceans and brought it back here for study."
],
"1450": [
"Hal",
"Hornfels doesn\u2019t know much about it yet, just that it\u2019s <em>crazy</em> old and super tough. I wonder why the Nomai carved it?"
],
"1451": [
"Hal",
"Apparently, Gabbro went back to Giant\u2019s Deep to try to learn more about the statue. Maybe they\u2019ll find some answers there."
],
"1452": [
"Hal",
"Good question! You know how Gabbro knocked a fragment off the statue while they were hauling it back from Giant's Deep?"
],
"1453": [
"Hal",
"Hornfels analyzed the fragment and figured out the stone it's made from can store information \u2014 I heard Slate ended up repurposing it for your ship\u2019s computer."
],
"1454": [
"Hal",
"I\u2019m not sure what the statue opening its eyes has to do with anything, but maybe the statue was made for storing information, too?"
],
"1455": [
"Hal",
"Hey, you never know \u2014 maybe you\u2019ll be the one to uncover the Nomai\u2019s mysteries!"
],

"Or maybe you\u2019ll discover a new kind of rock or something."
],

],

],
"1501": [
"Riebeck/Journal",
"Okay, let\u2019s see... I poked around a little, and there\u2019s some sort of old Nomai path that starts across from my campsite, inside the ruined building with trees growing out of it."
],
"1502": [
"Riebeck/Journal",
"Doesn\u2019t look like anything horrible - just stairs leading down. I can handle stairs! After I get my supplies together, I\u2019ll follow the path and see where it leads."
],
"1503": [
"Riebeck/Journal",
"Hurgh. Well. That was... deeply unpleasant. I made it this far, though. Guess that\u2019s the part to focus on, and not how I\u2019ll eventually have to get back <em>up</em> that path."
],
"1504": [
"Riebeck/Journal",
"But wow, this place sure is something! Looks like the Hanging City is north from here. And east is a gravity cannon! I <em>definitely</em> want to see that."
],

"As soon as I stop dry heaving, I\u2019m going to head farther down below so I can refill my tank."
],

"At first I thought this was an old Nomai settlement, but on closer inspection, I don\u2019t think anyone ever lived here. These buildings are atypical for Nomai dwellings."
],
"1508": [
"Riebeck/Journal",
"My best guess? This could be where the Nomai made gravity crystals. We know they mined raw from material from below the crust on Brittle Hollow, then refined that material to produce the crystals."
],
"1509": [
"Riebeck/Journal",
"Gravity crystals produce a local gravity distortion that affects the area around them, up to a certain radius. They\u2019re very clever! Nomai used them to anchor themselves to surfaces they might want to traverse down."
],

"Riebeck/Journal",
"We Hearthians have borrowed their technology in our ships, where gravity crystals keep astronauts anchored to just one flat plane (thank the stars!)."

],

],
"1515": [

"How did they keep the sand out? If it were me, I\u2019d be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand. Gosh, the Nomai sure were ingenius, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City! ...Wow!"
],
"1807": [
"Riebeck",
"That means there were two groups of Nomai \u2014 one that lived on Ember Twin, and one that lived here on Brittle Hollow. But they must have traveled around the solar system, since Nomai writing can be found on other planets, too."

"Probably. Or actually, definitely. The other travelers carry instruments, so they don\u2019t bother whistling."

"Esker",
"Using the outpost cut down on the number of launches and landings taking place in the village and also the number of fires. Nowadays, though, it\u2019s mostly just me up here raising saplings from Timber Hearth and keeping an eye on things."

"Esker",
"Heh, Marl is probably the only one who remembers I\u2019m up here. I should go see the big lug soon."

"2162": [
"Esker",

],
"2185": [
"Feldspar/Journal",

"Me too!"

"One of the islands on Giant\u2019s Deep has a Nomai statue on the beach - ever seen one? I brought one back to Timber Hearth with me. Big stone sculpture of a Nomai\u2019s head, three eyes and everything. Beautifully carved, too."
],
"2194": [
"Gabbro",
"So one minute I\u2019m standing on an island looking at a Nomai sculpture on the beach, and the next thing I know, it\u2019s looking back at me, glowing."
],
"2195": [
"Gabbro",
"The sculpture replays everything I\u2019ve just done, like it\u2019s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything\u2019s normal again."
],
"2196": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"That happened to me at the observatory."
],
"2197": [
"Gabbro",
"You too, huh?"

"2198": [
"Gabbro",
"You\u2019re saying the statue I brought to the museum started glowing at you? Yeah, sounds about right."

"2200": [
"Gabbro",
"It replays everything I\u2019ve just done, like it\u2019s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything\u2019s normal again."

"2201": [
"Gabbro",
"It didn\u2019t seem bad, just... weird? Were we the only ones who saw that happen?"
],
"2202": [
"Gabbro",
"I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them about it, but they told me I must have just nodded off out here and gotten confused."
],
"2203": [
"Gabbro",
"Then we talked about dreams until Hornfels told me to go refill my oxygen tank before I talked myself to death."
],
"2204": [
"Gabbro",
"So that\u2019s what\u2019s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! Let\u2019s talk about you, you know?"
],
"2205": [
"Gabbro",
"Have you ever stared at a cyclone for so long, it started to hypnotize you? I\u2019m telling you, they\u2019ll pull you into a trance if you look at \u2019em long enough."
],
"2206": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"I found a photo of you inside the old radio tower."
],
"2207": [
"Gabbro",
"Well, what are any of us doing here, really?"
],
"2208": [
"Gabbro",
"...Nah, I\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019m out here exploring our solar system, same as you."
],
"2209": [
"Gabbro",
"But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It\u2019s quiet and peaceful out here."
],
"2210": [
"Gabbro",
"I mean, it\u2019s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful."
],
"2211": [
"Gabbro",
"Here\u2019s something you might like \u2014 I saw a bright flash in the sky not too long ago. Something must have happened up there in orbit around the planet."
],
"2212": [
"Gabbro",
"What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been calling it, seeing as it\u2019s the <em>island</em> where I found the glowing Nomai <em>statue</em>. ...Get it?"
],
"2213": [
"Gabbro",
"I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It\u2019s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale."
],
"2214": [
"Gabbro",
"If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it\u2019s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You\u2019ll see."
],
"2215": [
"Gabbro",
"Haha, I know, right?"
],
"2216": [
"Gabbro",
"...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant\u2019s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there."
],
"2217": [
"Gabbro",
"There\u2019s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked."
],
"2218": [
"Gabbro",
"As for land masses, I\u2019ve counted four islands, including this one. There\u2019s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach."
],
"2219": [
"Gabbro",
"You\u2019ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they\u2019re hard to miss. They\u2019ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip \u2014 if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you."
],
"2220": [
"Gabbro",
"Nice, it\u2019s you. Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn\u2019t it?"
],
"2221": [
"Gabbro",
"So hey, don\u2019t laugh, but I think I might have just, like, died? Somehow?"
],
"2222": [
"Gabbro",
"Do you remember, y\u2019know, dying a few minutes ago? Maybe?"
],
"2223": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"Oh yeah, we definitely died."
],
"2224": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"I think we\u2019re the only ones who know."
],
"2225": [
"Gabbro",
"Okay, cool, that\u2019s what I thought. It was all way too vivid to be a dream."
],
"2226": [
"Gabbro",
"I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them if they had died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical."
],
"2227": [
"Gabbro",
"Yeah, I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them if they had died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical or something."
],
"2228": [
"Gabbro",
"Well, if you remember dying, then I guess I didn\u2019t just fall asleep and have a bad dream or something. I dunno what\u2019s going on, though. Today\u2019s been weird."
],
"2229": [
"Gabbro",
"Like, I was on a different island earlier, right? I was on the beach looking at one of those big stone statues of a Nomai head, and the next thing I know, it\u2019s looking back at me, glowing."
],
"2230": [
"Gabbro",
"The statue replays everything I\u2019ve just done, like it\u2019s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything\u2019s normal again."
],
"2231": [
"Gabbro/Me",
"That happened to me at the observatory."
],
"2232": [
"Gabbro",
"Come to think of it, when I died, I saw what I\u2019m pretty sure were my memories going backward, just like that time with the statue. Do you think the Nomai statues are related to us dying somehow?"
],
"2233": [
"Gabbro",
"And another thing - we died, but we aren\u2019t dead? That\u2019s pretty unusual for Hearthians."
],
"2234": [
"Gabbro",
"Well, that\u2019s what\u2019s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! Let\u2019s talk about you, you know?"

"2257": [
"Gabbro",
"Well, if you remember dying, then I guess I didn\u2019t just fall asleep and have a weird dream or something. But stars above, what\u2019s going on, then? And then there was that thing with the Nomai statue earlier..."
],
"2258": [
"Gabbro",
"Come to think of it, when I died, I saw what I\u2019m pretty sure were my memories going backward, just like the time with that statue. Do you think the Nomai statues are related to us dying somehow?"
],
"2259": [
"Gabbro",
"So... we died, but we aren\u2019t dead? That\u2019s pretty unusual for Hearthians."
],
"2260": [

],
"2265": [
"Gabbro",
"But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It\u2019s quiet and peaceful out here."
],
"2266": [
"Gabbro",
"I mean, it\u2019s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful."
],
"2267": [
"Gabbro",
"Well actually, after waking up from, you know, dying, I saw the same bright flash in the sky. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet."
],
"2268": [
"Gabbro",
"What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been calling it, seeing as it\u2019s the <em>island</em> where I found the glowing Nomai <em>statue</em>. ...Get it?"
],
"2269": [
"Gabbro",
"I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It\u2019s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale."
],
"2270": [
"Gabbro",
"If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it\u2019s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You\u2019ll see."
],
"2271": [
"Gabbro",
"Haha, I know, right?"
],
"2272": [
"Gabbro",
"...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant\u2019s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there."
],
"2273": [
"Gabbro",
"There\u2019s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked."
],
"2274": [
"Gabbro",
"As for land masses, I\u2019ve counted four islands, including this one. There\u2019s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach."
],
"2275": [
"Gabbro",
"You\u2019ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they\u2019re hard to miss. They\u2019ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip - if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you."

],
"2298": [
"Hornfels",
"We\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of the Nomai writing in our solar system, so we still know very little about them. We\u2019ve no idea if they originated here or traveled here, or why they disappeared."
],

"Hornfels",
"That tool of yours should prove indispensible in solving the mystery of this ancient species!"
],

"2302": [
"Hornfels",
"And... Well, there\u2019s Feldspar, obviously, but of course we don\u2019t know where they are, or if they\u2019re even alive."
],
"2303": [
"Hornfels",
"Feldspar has been lost for a very long time, I\u2019m afraid."
],
"2304": [
"Hornfels",
"...On a more cheerful note, you\u2019ll find Esker stationed on the Attlerock. They\u2019re not a traveler so much as a lunar local, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019d appreciate a visit nevertheless."
],
"2305": [
"Hornfels",
"I like it! You\u2019ll have plenty of options to choose from."
],
"2306": [

"No one\u2019s ever landed on the Interloper before, you know. Perhaps you\u2019ll be the first?"
],
"2307": [
"Hornfels",
"I must say... Should you choose to go to Dark Bramble, be <em>very</em> careful. No one\u2019s explored there before, either, for what you\u2019ll find are excellent reasons."
],
"2308": [
"Hornfels",
"You\u2019d prefer to ease into things? That\u2019s a sensible plan! More sensible than most of our astronauts tend to be, and that\u2019s a fact."
],
"2309": [
"Hornfels",
"Do you think you\u2019ll go to the Attlerock, then? Our moon would be a safe place to travel to and get your bearings in space, and I\u2019m sure Esker would appreciate the visit."
],
"2310": [
"Hornfels",
"Plus, we don\u2019t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!"

"Haha! Overwhelmed by the options, perhaps? I don\u2019t blame you."
],
"2312": [
"Hornfels",

"Feldspar was one of the four founding members of Outer Wilds, along with our flight coach Gossan, Slate the engineer, and me."
],
"2337": [
"Hornfels",
"As ground control and later the museum curator, I didn\u2019t work with Feldspar as closely as Slate and Gossan did. I <em>can</em> tell you Feldspar was absolutely fearless, though. Nothing scared them."
],
"2338": [
"Hornfels",
"Test-piloted everything Slate ever built! It\u2019s a wonder Feldspar lived to see space, frankly, but they did. Flew all sorts of dangerous stunts and explored everything they could find."
],
"2339": [
"Hornfels",
"And then one day, they just... didn\u2019t come back. We don\u2019t know what happened, or where Feldspar went, or even whether they\u2019re still alive."
],
"2340": [
"Hornfels",

"2342": [
"Hornfels",
"...How wonderful for you."
],
"2343": [
"Hornfels",
"No, truly, that\u2019s wonderful! It really is. ...Even if I <em>have</em> been pouring over it every night for weeks. It\u2019s stupendous you were able to get a reaction from the statue just by glancing at it a few times."
],
"2344": [
"Hornfels",
"Ergh, sorry, that\u2019s not a very scientific thing to say, is it? I <em>am</em> glad. I\u2019m just also insufferably, <em>profoundly</em> jealous. You\u2019ll have to forgive me."
],
"2345": [
"Hornfels",
"That aside - I have research to do! I wonder why the statue opened its eyes. Surely this means they aren\u2019t mere decorative ornaments...?"

"You found Feldspar?! And they\u2019re in Dark Bramble?! Stars above, this is wonderful news! Thank you! Thank you for finding them!"
],
"2347": [
"Hornfels",
"That Feldspar didn\u2019t immediately join you on your ship and return here is incredibly Feldspar of them. We were never entirely sure what Feldspar was thinking back then, either."
],
"2348": [
"Hornfels",
"Still, we ought to fish them out of that dreadful place with all haste! I\u2019ll radio Gossan and have them prepare a ship. It really should be Gossan who brings Feldspar home."
],
"2349": [
"Hornfels",
"Again, thank you. You can hardly imagine how profoundly happy I am to hear they\u2019re alive and unharmed."
],
