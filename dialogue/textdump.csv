Why did you let me go? /			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E7Don't you realize that&being nice.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E1... just makes you&get hurt?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Look at yourself./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9You made all these&great friends.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0But now^1, you'll probably&never see them again./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9Not to mention how&much they've been&set back by you./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6Hurts^1, doesn't it?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E7If you had just gone&through without caring&about anyone.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6You wouldn't have to&feel bad now./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0So I don't get it./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E7If you really did&everything the right&way../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Why did things still&end up like this?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6Why...?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5Is life really&that unfair?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Say./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9What if I told you.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end

\E9You'll have to load&your SAVE file, and.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9You'll have to&start over^1, and.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Well, in the meantime^1,&why don't you go see&Dr. Alphys?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Well^1, in the meantime^1,&why don't you go see&Undyne?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Well^1, in the meantime^1,&why don't you go see&Papyrus^1, then Undyne?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9It seems like you&could have been&better friends./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
Who knows..^1. maybe&she's got the key&to your happiness...?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4See you soon./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
But^1, despite everything^1,&your happy ending&didn't come./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5Why...?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4I know why./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4Go to Dr. Alphys./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5Your date with her&has really just&begun./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
So you went the&whole way through&without killing.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5And then you decided&to kill ASGORE?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6What the hell is&WRONG with you?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4You COMPLETELY missed&the point./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E2Are you trolling me?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Because./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4No./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5You are only&trolling yourself./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6What a waste of&everybody's time./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E7All you had to&do was make friends./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
With Papyrus^1, Undyne^1,&and then Alphys./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E2But you were too&busy messing it up!/%%			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
Hey./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
Since you defeated me./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
I've been thinking./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E3Is killing things&really necessary?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E1I.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E3I honestly don't&know anymore./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0I have a request&for you./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4Prove to me.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5Prove to me you&are strong enough&to survive./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6Get here from&the beginning./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Without killing a&single thing.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4... and I won't&kill the king./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4... and^1, maybe.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
"\E7Then you'll have&your so-called&""happy ending.""/"			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6So^1, what will&it be?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5Will you prove&yourself?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E8Or will I get to&watch you suffer...?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
Either way^1, I'm&interested!!!/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4Hee hee hee.../%%			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
Interesting.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6So^1, even with&everything you did.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5The outcome's still&the same./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9In the end^1, your&choices were an&illusion./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9NOTHING you do&really matters!/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E8Hee hee hee!/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E8.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Well./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6You DID do what&I told you./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5I guess it's up&to me to get you a&REAL happy ending./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0For starters^1, you&can't do it by&yourself./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
Papyrus^1, Undyne^1,&Alphys..^1. these guys./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4Are you friends with&all of them yet?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
"\E5Maybe you should go&back and..^1. ""hang""&with them./"			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4The power of&friendship.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
That always saves&the day^1, right?/%%			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0So^1, killing people&is ACTUALLY fine...?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4Sure./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
I'm glad we agree on&the value of a life./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
I've learned SO&MUCH from you./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0Though..^1. are you&REALLY gonna keep&doing things halfway?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E8The amount of people&you killed.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9It's honestly&DISAPPOINTING./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E8You IDIOT./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4You really can't do&ANYTHING right./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end

\E1Making me watch you&act so pure and&happy^1, while I...?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end

\E5Heh.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9You really DON'T&get it^1, do you?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5There's only one&person I could care&about anymore./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E6And even then^1, I&couldn't TRULY care&about them./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5I just like to think&there's someone out&there.../			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
Someone that I&won't get tired of./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E8Someone like ME./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4Quit looking at me&with that stupid&expression./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
You're pissing me&off./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end

\E2What's wrong with&you?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4Are you trying to&start the Flowey&Fan Club?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end

\E5A few different&times^1, anyway./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0I won't lie./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4He's one of the&better characters&to mess around with./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5Took me a long&time to get bored&of that one./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E7... Yeah./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4Talk to him&about it./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E0So./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E4Did you start the&Flowey Fan Club?/			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5Ha^1.&I'm just kidding./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E9I was watching^1.&I know you didn't./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end	
\E5But I don't care^1.&Really./			Flowey	New Home	room_undertale_end

One being with the&power to erase&EVERYTHING.../			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E1Everything everyone's&worked so hard for./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E6You know who I'm&talking about^1, don't&you?/			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E1That's right./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E4I'm talking about YOU./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E7YOU still have the&power to reset&everything./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E0Toriel^1, Sans^1, Asgore^1,&Alphys, Papyrus, Undyne.../			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
If you so choose.../			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
Everyone will be&ripped from this&timeline.../			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
... and sent back before&all of this&ever happened./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E6Nobody will&remember anything./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E5You'll be able to&do whatever you&want./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E7That power./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E3I know that power./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E6That's the power&you were fighting to&stop^1, wasn't it?/			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E7The power that I&wanted to use./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E6But now^1, the idea&of resetting&everything.../			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E7I.../			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E1I don't think I&could do it all&again./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
Not after that./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E1So, please./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E3Just let them go./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
Let Frisk be happy./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
Let Frisk live&their life./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E3But./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
If I can't change&your mind./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
If you DO end up&erasing everything.../			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E6You have to erase&my memories^1, too./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E6I'm sorry./			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret	
\E5You've probably heard&this a hundred times&already^1, haven't you...?/			Flowey	New Home	room_flowey_regret

\E9Today's gonna be&just as fun./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle

I was so scared./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E2I couldn't feel my&arms or my legs.../			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1My entire body had&turned into a&flower!/			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
"\E5""Mom^1! Dad^1!&Somebody help me^1!""&I called out./"			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E9But nobody came./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1Eventually^1, the king&found me^1, crying in&the garden./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
I explained what had&happened to him./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
Then he held me^1,&			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
He held me with&tears in his eyes^1,&saying.../			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
There^1, there^1.&Everything is going&to be alright./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
He was so..^1.&Emotional./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1But..^1.&For some reason.../			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1I didn't feel&anything at all./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1I soon realized I&didn't feel ANYTHING&about ANYONE./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
My compassion had&disappeared!/			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E7And believe me^1,&it's not like I&wasn't trying./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E3I wasted weeks with&that stupid king^1,&vainly hoping I would&feel something./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1But it became too&much for me./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
I ran away from&home./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
Eventually^1, I reached&the RUINS./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E0Inside I found HER^1,&			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
I thought of all&people^1, SHE could&make me feel whole&again./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E7She failed./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E6Ha ha.../%%			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1I realized those two&were useless./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
I became despondent./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
I just wanted to&love someone./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
I just wanted to&care about someone./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
^1, you might&not believe this.../			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E2But I decided..^1.&It wasn't worth&living anymore./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E7Not in a world&without love./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E6Not in a world&without you./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1So.../			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E0I decided to follow&in your footsteps./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1I would erase myself&from existence./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1And you know what?/			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E0I succeeded./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1But as I left this&mortal coil.../			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
I started to feel&apprehensive./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E9If you don't have&a SOUL^1, what happens&when you...?/			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1Something primal&started to burn&inside me./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
"No^1, I thought^1.&""I don't want to&die!""/"			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
Then I woke up./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
Like it was all&just a bad dream./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
I was back at the&garden./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
"\E0Back at my&""save point.""/%%"			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
Interested^1, I decided&to experiment./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
Again and again^1, I&brought myself to&the edge of death./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
At any point^1, I&could have let this&world continue on&without me./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
But as long as I&was determined to&live.../			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E0I could go back./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E6Amazing^1, isn't it^1,&			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle

I solved all their&problems flawlessly./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle

\E1For a while. /			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1As time repeated^1,&people proved&themselves&predictable./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
What would this&person say if I&gave them this?/			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
What would they do&if I said this to&them?/			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
Once you know the&answer^1, that's it./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
That's all they are./%%			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E1It all started&because I was&curious./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E0Curious what would&happen if I killed&them./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
"\E2""I don't like this^1,""&I told myself./"			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
"\E1""I'm just doing this&because I HAVE to&know what happens./"			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E8Ha ha ha..^1.&What an excuse!/			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E9You of all people&must know how&liberating it is to&act this way./			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle	
\E8At least we're better&than those sickos&that stand around and&WATCH it happen.../			Flowey	New Home	room_storybattle

\E2* Studying history sure is&  easy when you've lived through&  so much of it yourself^1!&*\E0 Wa ha ha!/%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* Long ago^1, ASGORE and I&  agreed that escaping would&  be pointless.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* Since once we left^1, humans&  would just kill us./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E1* I felt a little betrayed when&  he eventually changed his&  mind./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E4* But now^1, I think..^1.&* Maybe he was right to./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2

\E3* A human's killing us anyway^1,&  ain't that right?/%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
* OK^1, OK^1!&* I remember it clearly now./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* It was the monthly address at&  the castle^1, and the queen&  was giving her part on&  current events./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* After finishing her update^1,&  she moved to pass the&  microphone to the king./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2

\E3* A harbinger of destruction^1,&  waitin' to 'free' us from&  this mortal realm.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
* In my opinion^1, when I see&  that little circle.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E2* I jus' think it looks neat^1!&* Wahaha!/%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* That emblem actually predates&  written history^1.&* The original meaning has been&  lost to time.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E4* All we know is that the&  triangles symbolize us monsters&  below^1, and the winged circle&  above symbolizes.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* Somethin' else./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* Most people say it's the&  'angel^1,' from the prophecy.../%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2

\E1* What are they teaching you&  kids in school nowadays...^1?&*\E2 Wa ha ha!/			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\W*\E0 That's the \YDelta Rune^1,\W the&  emblem of our kingdom^1.&* The Kingdom.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2

* Ol' King Fluffybuns can't name&  for beans!/%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* Eh^1?&* Goat?/			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E2* Actually^1, that reminds me^1.&* Toriel once wore a flower-&  patterned muu-muu... /			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
"\E0* Folks kept saying ""nice muu-&  muu"" to her^1, but she kept&  thinking they were calling&  her a cow./"			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E1* So she never wore it again./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* What was the question again?/			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* Oh^1.&* Right^1.&* ASGORE./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* He's a real interesting&  type of monster^1.&* The strongest type of all./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* We call 'em Boss Monsters./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
* When they have an offspring^1,&  the SOUL power of the&  parents flows into the&  child.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
* Causing the child to grow&  as the parents age./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* But ASGORE doesn't have a&  child^1.&* So he's been stuck at the&  same age..^1.&* And probably will be forever./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E1* Huh^1?&* What if the child is a&  human...^1? What?/			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E1* Nah^1. That wouldn't work^1.&* So if ASGORE's your father^1,&  he'll definitely outlive&  you./%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2

\E1* Wah ha..^1.&* Knowledge like that is&  the only reason I've&  survived so long./%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
* King Fluffybuns^1?&* He's a friendly^1, happy-go-lucky&  kind of guy.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E4* If you keep walking around long&  enough^1, you'll probably meet him^1.&*\E0 He loves to walk around and&  talk to people./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* Eh^1?&* Why do I call Dreemurr&  'Fluffybuns?^1'&*\E2 Oh^1, that's a great story!/			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* I don't remember it./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
* But if you come back much&  later^1, I'm sure I'll have&  remembered by then./%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E2* Oh yeah^1!&* Of course^1.&* Toriel was queen^1, and&  Asgore was the king./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* It was tragic when she left./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E1* Since everyone knew she was&  really the brains behind the&  throne.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* But it was also just a&  teensy^1, teensy bit relieving^1,&  you know?/			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* Those two were really&  insufferable together..^1.&* Nuzzling noses^1, bein' all cute&  n' cuddly in public..^1.&* Embarrassing their children.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2

\E3* One attack from you^1, and&  then I'd... well.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E2* At least by talking to&  you^1, I've bought enough time&  for some of them to escape./%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* Undyne^1?&* Yeah^1, she's a local hero&  around here./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E4* Through grit and determination&  alone^1, she fought her way to&  the top of the Royal Guard./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* Actually^1, she just came through&  here asking about someone who&  looked just like you.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* I'd watch your back^1, kid^1.&* And buy some items..^1.&* It might just save your hide^1!&* Wa ha ha!/%%			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* Undyne^1.&* She's really come a long way&  since she was a little&  urchin./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E2* I used to be a hero myself^1,&  back in the old days^1.&* Gerson^1, the Hammer of Justice./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* When she was younger^1, Undyne&  would follow me around^1, to&  watch me beat up bad guys.../			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E0* Sometimes she'd even try&  to help!/			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2	
\E3* Though^1, most of the time&  the folks she attacked weren't&  bad guys^1.&* It'd be the mailman or&  something like that./			Gerson	Waterfall	room_shop2

\E4* Wow./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E6* Poor^1, naive little buddy^1.&* They've brainwashed you./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
"* ""Friendship"" is just a hot&  person's way of making you&  their slave./"			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* So^1, uh^1, what time would&  they wanna hang out?/%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* Huh^1?&* Yeah^1, those two vendors in back^1.&* The girls./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* NOT the Nice Cream guy./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
"\E5* He keeps coming in here and& asking me stuff like^1,&* ""Hey Burgy, what do you think& of this joke for my next& ice cream wrapper?""/"			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* Joke^1?&* Why are you calling it a JOKE?/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
"\E3* You drew a picture of two& dudes hugging and wrote& ""I love hugs!"" on it./"			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* You somehow understand comedy& EVEN LESS than that guy who& keeps going on stage and& crying about his family./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* Anyway^1, I^1, uh^1, just tell him& that they're good^1, because he& gives me the nice cream for& free afterward.../%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* Everyone calls me burgerpants&  now./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* But you won't^1, will you^1,&  little buddy?/%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E6* So I went out to the alley&  to see those two ladies^1, and&  uh..^1. you know^1, see what'd&  happen next./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* Then my boss^1, uh^1, saw me and&  asked me what I was doing./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E1* I was so startled^1, the hamburgers&  in my pockets tumbled out&  onto the ground./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* Not wanting to lose face^1,&  I scrambled to pick them up!/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* But^1, as I was leaning over^1,&  the weight of the remaining&  hamburgers.../			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* ... caused my pants to fall&  down./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* Then the girls laughed at me./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* Everyone calls me Burgerpants&  now./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E6* Listen^1.&* I like you^1, little buddy^1.&* So I'm gonna save you a lot&  of trouble./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* Never interact with attractive&  people./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
"\E6* Unless you're ""one of them^1,""&  they're just gonna take&  advantage of you./"			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* Like that time those two&  chicks asked me to sneak them&  some glamburgers./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E6* And I^1, naive teenager that&  I was^1, said yes to them./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* Bad idea./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* Those girls?&* The ones who saw my pants&  fall down?/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* Well^1, we're all gonna be&  free^1, so I'll never see&  them again^1, at least!/%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* So we're free now./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* Does that mean my double-&  date is cancelled...?/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* I know^1, it wasn't really&  a..^1.&* A date./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E6* Here's a trick^1, little buddy^1:&* Lie to yourself all the time^1.&* It makes you feel better./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* Well^1, Mettaton didn't tell me&  I HAD to work, I guess.../			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* But that's the thing^1!&* Sometimes he doesn't even&  call me into work until&  halfway into my shift!/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* If I don't play it safe^1,&  he's going to yell at me./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
"\E6* Okay^1, maybe ""yell"" is the&  wrong term./"			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* It's more like he has this..^1.&* CD album he plays.../			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* That's entirely full of&  songs about how bad I am&  at my job./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* Let's not talk about this./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E1* Why do people find him so&  attractive??/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* He's literally just a freaking&  rectangle./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
* You know^1, one time^1, I bought&  one of those^1, uh^1, kits&  online..^1. to.../			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* Uh^1, make yourself more&  rectangular./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* They don't work./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* God^1, have you even looked&  around^1?&* This place is a labyrinth of&  bad choices./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
"* And every time we try to change&  something for the better^1, he&  vetoes it and says ""that's not&  how they do it on the&  surface.""/"			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E1Oh! Right!/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* Humans are always eating&  hamburgers made of SEQUINS&  AND GLUE./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* When I first came to Hotland^1,&  it was my dream to work&  with Mettaton./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* Well^1, be careful what you&  wish for^1, little buddy!/%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* Don't tell anyone this^1, Little&  Buddy./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* (Because they'll make fun&  of me,)/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* But I..^1.&* I feel like I played a hand in&  everyone getting free&  somehow./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E1* Even if it was just&  working this awful job.../			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* I think I did something!/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* I don't know if it's true^1,&  but I'll believe it anyway!/%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* Huh?&* Everyone else is DEAD?/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E5* Does that mean I don't&  have to work today?/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E6* God^1.&* That it were true^1,&  little weirdo^1.&* That it were true./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* Future^1?&* WHAT future^1?&* Nothing down here EVER&  changes./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* I'll probably be trapped&  at this stupid job forever./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* But wait^1!&* There's one thing that keeps&  me going!/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
* If ASGORE gets just one&  more SOUL^1, we'll finally get&  to go to the surface!/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
* It'll be a brand new world^1!&* There's gotta be a second&  chance out there for me^1!&* For everyone!/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E6* So stay strong^1, little buddy^1.&* When I make it big^1, I'll&  keep you in mind./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* Little buddy^1!&* There's a brand new world&  out there waiting&  for us./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E6* I'm sure with my (ahem)&  qualifications^1, it won't&  be long before I'm a&  famous movie star.../			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E4* Or^1, maybe I'll just end up&  flipping burgers again./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E3* But it's as I say^1!&* Nowhere to go but up^1!&* Literally^1, in this case!/%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E6* Sorry^1, little weirdo^1.&* Threats won't work on me./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
* I can't go to hell^1.&* I'm all out of vacation&  days./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E0* I'm sorry^1, (Ha ha) it's against&  the rules to talk to customers&  who haven't bought anything./%%			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E1* What^1?&* Why do you keep trying to talk&  to me?/			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4	
\E1* I'll get in trouble if I get&  chummy with the customers./			Burgerpants	Hotland	room_shop4
